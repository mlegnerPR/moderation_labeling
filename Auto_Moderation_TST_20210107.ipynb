      "14917   Broken piece where the right end back rest slides in. I emailed to get a new part but was told they are made out of country and the only thing I can do is return it but i already took it out of box and the receipt said returns in original box only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "31943   I was given this carpet cleaner to try as part of the Stellar Product Testing Panel. Once it arrived, I plugged it in to charge. There is an easy to spot green battery light that tells you when the carpet cleaner is charging and when it is fully charged. I used the carpet cleaner on the seats of my car. It was simple to set up and begin using. The directions were clear and easy to understand. You just pour the solution in the container and press the power button, which activates the brush roll. There is a sprayer button that sprays the cleaning solution onto the area that needs to be clean. Make sure to keep your fingers out of the way of the sprayer. I accidentally got the cleaning solution on my hands and it stained my hands white but was gone the next day. The carpet cleaner was excellent at getting out light stains but had a more difficult time with heavy set in stains. It is satisfying to see all the dirty water being sucked back up by the carpet cleaner; however, I wish the carpet cleaner had a little bit more powerful suction. After use, it was super easy to clean. You just remove the dirty water tank, dump it out, and rinse with warm soapy water. The brush roll was also easy to remove and clean. My favorite feature of the carpet cleaner was that it was light and cordless which meant I could use it in my car and clean up the dirt and grime from my two young children and dog.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

      "184825  As a parent of a 4-year-old child and a 10-year-old Golden Retriever I am constantly dealing with messes from food/drink stains, pet stains, or what I like to call mystery stains. I have a home with a lot of carpet in common areas and bedrooms, and a white rug that is in a high traffic playroom/office.\\n\\nI was excited to try the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser PowerBrush due to being home for months at a time with my family and constantly dealing with stains from my family. It absolutely exceeded my expectations. The product is slightly larger than a clothes iron to hold and I appreciated how ergonomic it was to handle. After the initial charge time (this is a cordless product when in-use), it was very easy to set up and get to cleaning with the included sample Bissell + Oxy pet cleaning solution that requires no mixing. I first used this on set-in stains and with no pre-treating, the stains were lifted within minutes of using this PowerBrush technology. There was adequate suction to pull the liquids out of the carpet and the added drying time after I completed my carpet cleaning session was minimal since the carpets did not get soaked.\\n\\nI also felt like the targeted nozzle was excellent and very effective at putting the cleaning solution exactly where I needed it to go to get after the carpet spots. It was intuitive to use and was also small enough to not take up precious storage space in my home.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend this for residential carpets, rugs, and even for auto detailing to get stains out of the floor mats. I used it on both frieze carpeting and a low pile rug and had excellent results on both.\\n\\nThanks to the Stellar Product Testing Panel for providing me with this carpet cleaner.   \n",
      "193480  I was able to try out the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser Power Brush thanks to the Stellar Product Testing Panel.  This vacuum is a nifty little device for cleaning up small stains.  I was able to get about 5-10 small stains before the cleaning fluid ran out of the compartment (I have cats & kids).  Set up was quick and simple.  The instructions were clear and easy to understand.  The brush roll was fairly easy to remove and clean.  I think this cleaner is best for smaller surface stains.  The suction is very strong; it's so strong, that I felt like the cleaning fluid was being sucked up before the brushes had a chance to work it into the carpet.  One down side is that you have to be careful in the way that you hold the machine.  You can't tip it in certain positions.  I would almost rather use my larger cleaner with a hose attachment than use this.

      "231404  I was lucky to receive the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser PowerBrush to try via the Stellar Product Testing Panel. I have two cats that create their share of messes on our carpet and until now I had been trying to clean them up with water and a towel. There were certainly many stains on the carpet of our rental unit that I was trying to ignore, some quite old. When I opened the packaging, I was happy to see that it was all hassle-free packaging and contained very little excess plastic. It was easy to open up and set up - the quick start instructions were attached to the handle. After charging for a few hours as recommended, I filled it with the included cleaning solution and tried it on the stains. It removed them very quickly and easily. The carpet was a little more damp than I hoped for and the smell from the solution was fairly strong, but it dissipated quickly and dried in a reasonable time. \\n\\nWhen it came time to clean the unit, it was very easy to follow the instructions to disassemble and reassemble the brush and waste water tank. It was intuitive and simple as well, nice design. The portions that collected fur and hair from the carpet were easy to wipe and rinse clean.\\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this spot cleaner. It takes up little space, is very easy to use, and cleared the stains quickly and completely, even old, set in stains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "311733  I have only worn the Straight fit forever Calvin Klein Jeans for the past 5 years. They are always hit or miss. Some last forever some I have major issues with. I finally figured it out. I just purchased 3 pairs of the straight fit forever black jeans. After the first wash each of them were faded and lost their color. I was so angry cause this happened to me one other time. I just figured out the difference between my old pairs that I have had for over a year and the 3 new pairs that are garbage. The good ones are made in Bangladesh and the pairs that I always have issues with are from Mexico. Extremely disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
      "315055  I received this product to test through Stellar product testing panel. I was so excited to try this out as I need something like this so desperately with 3 dogs and a 3yr old in the house. I love that it's rechargeable, no cord or anything getting in the way while trying to get the job done. Filling it up and cleaning the tank was a breeze! However, I feel it needs some improvement. It doesn't seem to pick up any mess at all as it really lacks suction power. I could use everything in the solution reservoir but only get 1/4 of it back up if I was lucky. What little of the mess I could get up took a lot of strength and effort to get. You get great angles of spray but the machine pick up much on flat surfaces let alone awkward angles. I had to push down really firmly and hold tight to the area just to get a small amount. It really became frustrating trying to figure out how I could make it work better/like a typical carpet cleaner does. I'd be disappointed if I had paid for this. It is a really great concept but lacks in function. I could give a 5 star if the suction was improved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

      "337658  I have never received anything that was such a complete mess! Opened the box to find screws thrown throughout the entire box. Every single piece was scratched up, dented, or broken. Called Big Lots, and they agreed without question to send a replacement. But a week has gone by, I have still not received it, and if it is packed the same way I don't have high hopes that it won't also be damaged. Make sure if you buy this you have the time and patience deal with the headache. On a side note the manual is 15 pages long and clearly written by someone with English as a second language.

      "368501  For nearly a decade, I ordered this suit without a second thought - it was exactly what I needed.  My most recent order, put the new suit on and it felt different.  Where the old suit always felt nice and snug from my waist to thighs, this one feels like there's a rubber band around my waist and thighs, but no compression in between.  When I got out of the pool, there was little to the imagination.  I look at the tag and the materials are completely different.  New material feels cheap to me.

      "424705  Way big than expected!!! I bought this Monochrome and Carousel in size small, the carousel was ok but this Monochrome is 2 inches bigger and like I said they are both size SMALL. I just wasted my money because I had to remove the tag etc to get the item out of the hanger so I could not return it anymore. I've bought a lot from this site and it's the first time that this happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "427605  I have ordered this product this month. But I didnt receive my package so my package lost now. CalvinKlein dont refund . I dont recommend Anybody for ordering in this site. It is bad customer satisfaction. Customer service is zero(0).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

I'm very angry and disappointed!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "460061  Love that I am over 6 feet tall and this scooter still is comfortable to ride. It has plenty of power for going up hills as well. My favorite part is that the tires are air filled so riding over grass, dirt, or other bumpy surfaces is a breeze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Now this will cost me time, energy and shipping cost to return a bag I didn't order. 😷😂                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

      "31943   Bissell Homecare, Inc. Easy to use and great for light stains I was given this carpet cleaner to try as part of the Stellar Product Testing Panel. Once it arrived, I plugged it in to charge. There is an easy to spot green battery light that tells you when the carpet cleaner is charging and when it is fully charged. I used the carpet cleaner on the seats of my car. It was simple to set up and begin using. The directions were clear and easy to understand. You just pour the solution in the container and press the power button, which activates the brush roll. There is a sprayer button that sprays the cleaning solution onto the area that needs to be clean. Make sure to keep your fingers out of the way of the sprayer. I accidentally got the cleaning solution on my hands and it stained my hands white but was gone the next day. The carpet cleaner was excellent at getting out light stains but had a more difficult time with heavy set in stains. It is satisfying to see all the dirty water being sucked back up by the carpet cleaner; however, I wish the carpet cleaner had a little bit more powerful suction. After use, it was super easy to clean. You just remove the dirty water tank, dump it out, and rinse with warm soapy water. The brush roll was also easy to remove and clean. My favorite feature of the carpet cleaner was that it was light and cordless which meant I could use it in my car and clean up the dirt and grime from my two young children and dog.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "184825  Bissell Homecare, Inc. Deep Stain Removal As a parent of a 4-year-old child and a 10-year-old Golden Retriever I am constantly dealing with messes from food/drink stains, pet stains, or what I like to call mystery stains. I have a home with a lot of carpet in common areas and bedrooms, and a white rug that is in a high traffic playroom/office.\\n\\nI was excited to try the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser PowerBrush due to being home for months at a time with my family and constantly dealing with stains from my family. It absolutely exceeded my expectations. The product is slightly larger than a clothes iron to hold and I appreciated how ergonomic it was to handle. After the initial charge time (this is a cordless product when in-use), it was very easy to set up and get to cleaning with the included sample Bissell + Oxy pet cleaning solution that requires no mixing. I first used this on set-in stains and with no pre-treating, the stains were lifted within minutes of using this PowerBrush technology. There was adequate suction to pull the liquids out of the carpet and the added drying time after I completed my carpet cleaning session was minimal since the carpets did not get soaked.\\n\\nI also felt like the targeted nozzle was excellent and very effective at putting the cleaning solution exactly where I needed it to go to get after the carpet spots. It was intuitive to use and was also small enough to not take up precious storage space in my home.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend this for residential carpets, rugs, and even for auto detailing to get stains out of the floor mats. I used it on both frieze carpeting and a low pile rug and had excellent results on both.\\n\\nThanks to the Stellar Product Testing Panel for providing me with this carpet cleaner.   \n",
      "193480  Bissell Homecare, Inc. Bissell Pet Stain Eraser Power Brush - good small cleaner I was able to try out the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser Power Brush thanks to the Stellar Product Testing Panel.  This vacuum is a nifty little device for cleaning up small stains.  I was able to get about 5-10 small stains before the cleaning fluid ran out of the compartment (I have cats & kids).  Set up was quick and simple.  The instructions were clear and easy to understand.  The brush roll was fairly easy to remove and clean.  I think this cleaner is best for smaller surface stains.  The suction is very strong; it's so strong, that I felt like the cleaning fluid was being sucked up before the brushes had a chance to work it into the carpet.  One down side is that you have to be careful in the way that you hold the machine.  You can't tip it in certain positions.  I would almost rather use my larger cleaner with a hose attachment than use this.

      "231404  Bissell Homecare, Inc. Surprisingly Quick at Removing Old Stains! I was lucky to receive the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser PowerBrush to try via the Stellar Product Testing Panel. I have two cats that create their share of messes on our carpet and until now I had been trying to clean them up with water and a towel. There were certainly many stains on the carpet of our rental unit that I was trying to ignore, some quite old. When I opened the packaging, I was happy to see that it was all hassle-free packaging and contained very little excess plastic. It was easy to open up and set up - the quick start instructions were attached to the handle. After charging for a few hours as recommended, I filled it with the included cleaning solution and tried it on the stains. It removed them very quickly and easily. The carpet was a little more damp than I hoped for and the smell from the solution was fairly strong, but it dissipated quickly and dried in a reasonable time. \\n\\nWhen it came time to clean the unit, it was very easy to follow the instructions to disassemble and reassemble the brush and waste water tank. It was intuitive and simple as well, nice design. The portions that collected fur and hair from the carpet were easy to wipe and rinse clean.\\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this spot cleaner. It takes up little space, is very easy to use, and cleared the stains quickly and completely, even old, set in stains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

      "311733  Calvin Klein I would only buy again if from Bangladesh. I have only worn the Straight fit forever Calvin Klein Jeans for the past 5 years. They are always hit or miss. Some last forever some I have major issues with. I finally figured it out. I just purchased 3 pairs of the straight fit forever black jeans. After the first wash each of them were faded and lost their color. I was so angry cause this happened to me one other time. I just figured out the difference between my old pairs that I have had for over a year and the 3 new pairs that are garbage. The good ones are made in Bangladesh and the pairs that I always have issues with are from Mexico. Extremely disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "315055  Bissell Homecare, Inc. Okay but.. I received this product to test through Stellar product testing panel. I was so excited to try this out as I need something like this so desperately with 3 dogs and a 3yr old in the house. I love that it's rechargeable, no cord or anything getting in the way while trying to get the job done. Filling it up and cleaning the tank was a breeze! However, I feel it needs some improvement. It doesn't seem to pick up any mess at all as it really lacks suction power. I could use everything in the solution reservoir but only get 1/4 of it back up if I was lucky. What little of the mess I could get up took a lot of strength and effort to get. You get great angles of spray but the machine pick up much on flat surfaces let alone awkward angles. I had to push down really firmly and hold tight to the area just to get a small amount. It really became frustrating trying to figure out how I could make it work better/like a typical carpet cleaner does. I'd be disappointed if I had paid for this. It is a really great concept but lacks in function. I could give a 5 star if the suction was improved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "337658  Big Lots DO NOT BUY!! I have never received anything that was such a complete mess! Opened the box to find screws thrown throughout the entire box. Every single piece was scratched up, dented, or broken. Called Big Lots, and they agreed without question to send a replacement. But a week has gone by, I have still not received it, and if it is packed the same way I don't have high hopes that it won't also be damaged. Make sure if you buy this you have the time and patience deal with the headache. On a side note the manual is 15 pages long and clearly written by someone with English as a second language.

      "368501  SpeedoUSA.com materials changed - not happy For nearly a decade, I ordered this suit without a second thought - it was exactly what I needed.  My most recent order, put the new suit on and it felt different.  Where the old suit always felt nice and snug from my waist to thighs, this one feels like there's a rubber band around my waist and thighs, but no compression in between.  When I got out of the pool, there was little to the imagination.  I look at the tag and the materials are completely different.  New material feels cheap to me.

      "424705  Calvin Klein TOO BIG !!! Way big than expected!!! I bought this Monochrome and Carousel in size small, the carousel was ok but this Monochrome is 2 inches bigger and like I said they are both size SMALL. I just wasted my money because I had to remove the tag etc to get the item out of the hanger so I could not return it anymore. I've bought a lot from this site and it's the first time that this happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

I'm very angry and disappointed!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
      "460061  Razor USA LLC - TERMINATED Great Speed, Power, and Size Love that I am over 6 feet tall and this scooter still is comfortable to ride. It has plenty of power for going up hills as well. My favorite part is that the tires are air filled so riding over grass, dirt, or other bumpy surfaces is a breeze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "491738  Calvin Klein No Disgusted and disappointed. I ordered Calvin Klein Elaine Chestnut with  black trim, black lining and black strap according to the online attached photo but I received  \"a plain all brown hand bag with beige lining labeled Elaine  Chestnut\" there was no black trim, no black lining nor  black straps as pictured online.

      "144652  After seeing questions from people wondering about rust or sharpening blades, I wanted to reply.  I have been using my chopper for about 10 years, and have had no rust and the blades haven't gotten dull.  They rinse off easily and they clean well even when cutting greasy meat like sausage.  I use this chopper several times a week and it has held up great.  The only thing that I can complain about is the plastic clip at the top has loosened up over time and flops into the lock position at times.  This is definitely one of my favorite Pampered Chef purchases.   \n",

      "257708  I was pretty excited to receive my results but have been disappointed. By testing IgG and not both IgG and IgE response levels true allergies do not show up on this test, only sensitivities. So it has been helpful to identify one significant sensitivity but I have many along with allergies that I'll still need to order more tests to get a better understanding. Do not put all your eggs in this basket if you truly want to understand your sources of discomfort.                                                                                                        \n",

      "439047  I purchased this coat while visiting my son in Wyoming last week but had to have it shipped back to California as I was on my way home with bags packed.  Promised last Wednesday, received last Wednesday and was able to use it over the weekend at our place in the Sierra's near Truckee.  With a snow storm all weekend, starting with sleet - ending with about a six foot dump - I used it the entire weekend and never felt cold or wet once.  Likely the best winter coat I'll ever own - thank you.                                                                         \n",

The Trad Vanes produced very low decibels in a sound test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "693468  I'm still testing this one, it does have a better grip than my last multi-tool but not by a lot.

      "867484  I have been on statins for at least 3 years, so this past June 2019;I wanted to see if cq10 does make a difference so I stooped taking them. Have not changed my diet or exercise level and for the first 3 months have felt no difference. In September I started to feel extra tired and week at work. So in November I noticed a progression in tiredness and decided to re introduced CQ10 back in my system and by the end of December I feel less tired and more energy, so my guess is this stuff works,                                                                       \n",

      "144652  Pampered Chef Time tested After seeing questions from people wondering about rust or sharpening blades, I wanted to reply.  I have been using my chopper for about 10 years, and have had no rust and the blades haven't gotten dull.  They rinse off easily and they clean well even when cutting greasy meat like sausage.  I use this chopper several times a week and it has held up great.  The only thing that I can complain about is the plastic clip at the top has loosened up over time and flops into the lock position at times.  This is definitely one of my favorite Pampered Chef purchases.   \n",

      "257708  EverlyWell Mediocre test I was pretty excited to receive my results but have been disappointed. By testing IgG and not both IgG and IgE response levels true allergies do not show up on this test, only sensitivities. So it has been helpful to identify one significant sensitivity but I have many along with allergies that I'll still need to order more tests to get a better understanding. Do not put all your eggs in this basket if you truly want to understand your sources of discomfort.                                                                                                         \n",

Weather-tested I purchased this coat while visiting my son in Wyoming last week but had to have it shipped back to California as I was on my way home with bags packed.  Promised last Wednesday, received last Wednesday and was able to use it over the weekend at our place in the Sierra's near Truckee.  With a snow storm all weekend, starting with sleet - ending with about a six foot dump - I used it the entire weekend and never felt cold or wet once.  Likely the best winter coat I'll ever own - thank you.                                                             \n",

The instrument has low action, low enough the lighter tension allowed for some fret buzz, but they are quieter when fingering and play faster.

      "693468  Fingerhut Testing testing testing I'm still testing this one, it does have a better grip than my last multi-tool but not by a lot. The pouch is very basic and I feel that the retention loop is kind of not needed but it's nice to have.
