      "0  These boxes get less nuts each year. These were half full of chocolate nuts. Weight goes down approx. 1 oz every few years. Cups not full. Plastic wrap filler instead of chocolate candy. The Russell Stover quality is there, But not the quantity. Feel like I'm being short changed every time I open these old 1 lb. (16 oz) boxes. Don't really want to purchase any more. They were a family treat for Christmas & presents. Guess I remember when.   \n",

On every single box and bag ect. it says there are 100 water balloons on the plastic things I have counted all of the ones from  my most recent box and it only has 100. that is unacceptable I paid for 1000 water balloons from zuru and only got 350. If there we 10 plastics and 100 on each I should have got 1000 but I only got 350 that is unacceptable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "2295  Terrible customer service.  I purchased a 3.5 hp Mercury outboard from West Marine to use on my 10' dinghy.   It was very difficult to get started and then once running for a few minutes it dies and won't start again. I returned it to West Marine and they refused to take it back and they have no service department.  They say to take it to an authorized mercury dealer.   I called several Mercury dealers and they would not do anything because I did not buy it from them.   Finally I found Lake Union SeaRay in Fife, WA.  They fixed it and now it runs great. I know where I am buying my next outboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "3374  Gave this to my grandson, along with Shutterfly playing cards, as an Easter gift. My grandson loved that his picture was plastered all over the cards and his family was depicted on the puzzle. (he thinks the Easter Bunny spied on him to take all of those pictures) I got the 252 piece puzzle due to his young age but I liked that there were many choices as far as number of pieces and designs to select from. The pieces are sturdy for little hands and the pieces fit together well, not like those cheap cardboard puzzles from the Dollar Store. The images are crisp and vivid just like all Shutterfly products. The best part is, like all products offered by Shutterfly, it was easy to create. It took just a few minutes to select a design and the photos. I like that I could easily upload photos from Google or use ones that I had stored in Shutterfly from previous projects. It took me only minutes to make something that will last forever and will give great joy to my grandson for years to come. I am sure he will treasure it when he gets older and has kids of his own too.   \n",

      "4100  I fell in love with good girl gone bad extreme after attending a Kilian fragrance class at Saks Fifth Avenue. I was able to experience all Kilian fragrance's and this was by far the best in my opinion. I worked in fragrances and I've never smelled anything like it and you feel sexy and luxurious when you wear it. I receive so many compliments and a must-have for any date night, exclusive event, or perfect to just wear naked ;) It comes in a snake clutch which protects the gorgeous bottle inside that has beautiful snake and floral details. Everything about this fragrance is sexy and a true gem if you are lucky to find it. If you don't believe me...it's soldout currently for a reason. I am proud to call this my signature scent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
      "5356  I really have been enjoying this bubble stick! And surprisingly I have already gotten at least 5 baths out of it and still have some left. And it does make a fair amount of bubbles. Turns the water a greyish purple. And looks very relaxing. Also smells very nice. It pairs well with any lavender bath salts or the Pacifica bath tea packs. Makes a great bath. If u want a bubble bar that is relaxing and colors the water some & ain't super overpowering with scent this is for u! I find it's very worth the money and u get a good bang for ur buck with all the baths u get out of it!!! It does leave some light purple residue on the bottom of my tub but comes off easily with a washcloth and water. Or jus by rubbing my hand on it. Doesn't stain skin or anything like that tho. I def recommend it! Especially those people who r looking for something that is worth the price tag !                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "3374  perfect for gift for my 5 yr. old grandson! gave this to my grandson, along with shutterfly playing cards, as an easter gift. my grandson loved that his picture was plastered all over the cards and his family was depicted on the puzzle. (he thinks the easter bunny spied on him to take all of those pictures) i got the 252 piece puzzle due to his young age but i liked that there were many choices as far as number of pieces and designs to select from. the pieces are sturdy for little hands and the pieces fit together well, not like those cheap cardboard puzzles from the dollar store. the images are crisp and vivid just like all shutterfly products. the best part is, like all products offered by shutterfly, it was easy to create. it took just a few minutes to select a design and the photos. i like that i could easily upload photos from google or use ones that i had stored in shutterfly from previous projects. it took me only minutes to make something that will last forever and will give great joy to my grandson for years to come. i am sure he will treasure it when he gets older and has kids of his own too.   \n",

      "4100  just buy it... i fell in love with good girl gone bad extreme after attending a kilian fragrance class at saks fifth avenue. i was able to experience all kilian fragrance's and this was by far the best in my opinion. i worked in fragrances and i've never smelled anything like it and you feel sexy and luxurious when you wear it. i receive so many compliments and a must-have for any date night, exclusive event, or perfect to just wear naked ;) it comes in a snake clutch which protects the gorgeous bottle inside that has beautiful snake and floral details. everything about this fragrance is sexy and a true gem if you are lucky to find it. if you don't believe me...it's soldout currently for a reason. i am proud to call this my signature scent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "5356  very relaxing scent and color! i really have been enjoying this bubble stick! and surprisingly i have already gotten at least 5 baths out of it and still have some left. and it does make a fair amount of bubbles. turns the water a greyish purple. and looks very relaxing. also smells very nice. it pairs well with any lavender bath salts or the pacifica bath tea packs. makes a great bath. if u want a bubble bar that is relaxing and colors the water some & ain't super overpowering with scent this is for u! i find it's very worth the money and u get a good bang for ur buck with all the baths u get out of it!!! it does leave some light purple residue on the bottom of my tub but comes off easily with a washcloth and water. or jus by rubbing my hand on it. doesn't stain skin or anything like that tho. i def recommend it! especially those people who r looking for something that is worth the price tag !                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "3374  perfect for gift for my 5 yr. old grandson! gave this to my grandson, along with  playing cards, as an easter gift. my grandson loved that his picture was plastered all over the cards and his family was depicted on the puzzle. (he thinks the easter bunny spied on him to take all of those pictures) i got the 252 piece puzzle due to his young age but i liked that there were many choices as far as number of pieces and designs to select from. the pieces are sturdy for little hands and the pieces fit together well, not like those cheap cardboard puzzles from the dollar store. the images are crisp and vivid just like all  products. the best part is, like all products offered by , it was easy to create. it took just a few minutes to select a design and the photos. i like that i could easily upload photos from google or use ones that i had stored in  from previous projects. it took me only minutes to make something that will last forever and will give great joy to my grandson for years to come. i am sure he will treasure it when he gets older and has kids of his own too.   \n",

      "4100  just buy it... i fell in love with good girl gone bad extreme after attending a kilian fragrance class at saks fifth avenue. i was able to experience all kilian fragrance's and this was  far the best in my opinion. i worked in fragrances and i've never smelled anything like it and you feel sexy and luxurious when you wear it. i receive so many compliments and a must-have for any date night, exclusive event, or perfect to just wear naked ;) it comes in a snake clutch which protects the gorgeous bottle inside that has beautiful snake and floral details. everything about this fragrance is sexy and a true gem if you are lucky to find it. if you don't believe me...it's soldout currently for a reason. i am proud to call this my signature scent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "5356  very relaxing scent and color! i really have been enjoying this bubble stick! and surprisingly i have already gotten at least 5 baths out of it and still have some left. and it does make a fair amount of bubbles. turns the water a greyish purple. and looks very relaxing. also smells very nice. it pairs well with any lavender bath salts or the pacifica bath tea packs. makes a great bath. if u want a bubble bar that is relaxing and colors the water some & ain't super overpowering with scent this is for u! i find it's very worth the money and u get a good bang for ur buck with all the baths u get out of it!!! it does leave some light purple residue on the bottom of my tub but comes off easily with a washcloth and water. or jus by rubbing my hand on it. doesn't stain skin or anything like that tho. i def recommend it! especially those people who r looking for something that is worth the price tag !                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "3374  perfect for gift for my 5 yr. old grandson! gave this to my grandson, along with  playing cards, as an easter gift. my grandson loved that his picture was plastered all over the cards and his family was depicted on the puzzle. (he thinks the easter bunny spied on him to take all of those pictures) i got the 252 piece puzzle due to his young age but i liked that there were many choices as far as number of pieces and designs to select from. the pieces are sturdy for little hands and the pieces fit together well, not like those cheap cardboard puzzles from the dollar store. the images are crisp and vivid just like all  products. the best part is, like all products offered by , it was easy to create. it took just a few minutes to select a design and the photos. i like that i could easily upload photos from google or use ones that i had stored in  from previous projects. it took me only minutes to make something that will last forever and will give great joy to my grandson for years to come. i am sure he will treasure it when he gets older and has kids of his own too.   \n",

      "5356  very relaxing scent and color! i really have been enjoying this bubble stick! and surprisingly i have already gotten at least 5 baths out of it and still have some left. and it does make a fair amount of bubbles. turns the water a greyish purple. and looks very relaxing. also smells very nice. it pairs well with any lavender bath salts or the pacifica bath tea packs. makes a great bath. if u want a bubble bar that is relaxing and colors the water some & ain't super overpowering with scent this is for u! i find it's very worth the money and u get a good bang for ur buck with all the baths u get out of it!!! it does leave some light purple residue on the bottom of my tub but comes off easily with a washcloth and water. or jus by rubbing my hand on it. doesn't stain skin or anything like that tho. i def recommend it! especially those people who r looking for something that is worth the price tag !                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "3374  perfect for gift for my 5 yr. old grandson! gave this to my grandson, along with  playing cards, as an easter gift. my grandson loved that his picture was plastered all over the cards and his family was depicted on the puzzle. (he thinks the easter bunny spied on him to take all of those pictures) i got the 252 piece puzzle due to his young age but i liked that there were many choices as far as number of pieces and designs to select from. the pieces are sturdy for little hands and the pieces fit together well, not like those cheap cardboard puzzles from the dollar store. the images are crisp and vivid just like all  products. the best part is, like all products offered by , it was easy to create. it took just a few minutes to select a design and the photos. i like that i could easily upload photos from google or use ones that i had stored in  from previous projects. it took me only minutes to make something that will last forever and will give great joy to my grandson for years to come. i am sure he will treasure it when he gets older and has kids of his own too.   \n",

      "4100  just buy it... i fell in love with good girl gone bad extreme after attending a kilian fragrance class at saks fifth avenue. i was able to experience all kilian fragrance's and this was  far the best in my opinion. i worked in fragrances and i've never smelled anything like it and you feel sexy and luxurious when you wear it. i receive so many compliments and a must-have for any date night, exclusive event, or perfect to just wear naked ;) it comes in a snake clutch which protects the gorgeous bottle inside that has beautiful snake and floral details. everything about this fragrance is sexy and a true gem if you are lucky to find it. if you don't believe me...it's soldout currently for a reason. i am proud to call this my signature scent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "5356  very relaxing scent and color! i really have been enjoying this bubble stick! and surprisingly i have already gotten at least 5 baths out of it and still have some left. and it does make a fair amount of bubbles. turns the water a greyish purple. and looks very relaxing. also smells very nice. it pairs well with any lavender bath salts or the pacifica bath tea packs. makes a great bath. if u want a bubble bar that is relaxing and colors the water some & ain't super overpowering with scent this is for u! i find it's very worth the money and u get a good bang for ur buck with all the baths u get out of it!!! it does leave some light purple residue on the bottom of my tub but comes off easily with a washcloth and water. or jus by rubbing my hand on it. doesn't stain skin or anything like that tho. i def recommend it! especially those people who r looking for something that is worth the price tag !                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "3374  perfect for gift for my 5 yr. old grandson! gave this to my grandson, along with  playing cards, as an easter gift. my grandson loved that his picture was plastered all over the cards and his family was depicted on the puzzle. (he thinks the easter bunny spied on him to take all of those pictures) i got the 252 piece puzzle due to his young age but i liked that there were many choices as far as number of pieces and designs to select from. the pieces are sturdy for little hands and the pieces fit together well, not like those cheap cardboard puzzles from the dollar store. the images are crisp and vivid just like all  products. the best part is, like all products offered by , it was easy to create. it took just a few minutes to select a design and the photos. i like that i could easily upload photos from google or use ones that i had stored in  from previous projects. it took me only minutes to make something that will last forever and will give great joy to my grandson for years to come. i am sure he will treasure it when he gets older and has kids of his own too.   \n",

      "4100  just buy it... i fell in love with good girl gone bad extreme after attending a kilian fragrance class at saks fifth avenue. i was able to experience all kilian fragrance's and this was  far the best in my opinion. i worked in fragrances and i've never smelled anything like it and you feel sexy and luxurious when you wear it. i receive so many compliments and a must-have for any date night, exclusive event, or perfect to just wear naked ;) it comes in a snake clutch which protects the gorgeous bottle inside that has beautiful snake and floral details. everything about this fragrance is sexy and a true gem if you are lucky to find it. if you don't believe me...it's soldout currently for a reason. i am proud to call this my signature scent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "5356  very relaxing scent and color! i really have been enjoying this bubble stick! and surprisingly i have already gotten at least 5 baths out of it and still have some left. and it does make a fair amount of bubbles. turns the water a greyish purple. and looks very relaxing. also smells very nice. it pairs well with any lavender bath salts or the pacifica bath tea packs. makes a great bath. if u want a bubble bar that is relaxing and colors the water some & ain't super overpowering with scent this is for u! i find it's very worth the money and u get a good bang for ur buck with all the baths u get out of it!!! it does leave some light purple residue on the bottom of my tub but comes off easily with a washcloth and water. or jus by rubbing my hand on it. doesn't stain skin or anything like that tho. i def recommend it! especially those people who r looking for something that is worth the price tag !                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "3374  perfect for gift for my 5 yr. old grandson! gave this to my grandson, along with  playing cards, as an easter gift. my grandson loved that his picture was plastered all over the cards and his family was depicted on the puzzle. (he thinks the easter bunny spied on him to take all of those pictures) i got the 252 piece puzzle due to his young age but i liked that there were many choices as far as number of pieces and designs to select from. the pieces are sturdy for little hands and the pieces fit together well, not like those cheap cardboard puzzles from the dollar store. the images are crisp and vivid just like all  products. the best part is, like all products offered by , it was easy to create. it took just a few minutes to select a design and the photos. i like that i could easily upload photos from google or use ones that i had stored in  from previous projects. it took me only minutes to make something that will last forever and will give great joy to my grandson for years to come. i am sure he will treasure it when he gets older and has kids of his own too.   \n",

      "5356  very relaxing scent and color! i really have been enjoying this bubble stick! and surprisingly i have already gotten at least 5 baths out of it and still have some left. and it does make a fair amount of bubbles. turns the water a greyish purple. and looks very relaxing. also smells very nice. it pairs well with any lavender bath salts or the pacifica bath tea packs. makes a great bath. if u want a bubble bar that is relaxing and colors the water some & ain't super overpowering with scent this is for u! i find it's very worth the money and u get a good bang for ur buck with all the baths u get out of it!!! it does leave some light purple residue on the bottom of my tub but comes off easily with a washcloth and water. or jus by rubbing my hand on it. doesn't stain skin or anything like that tho. i def recommend it! especially those people who r looking for something that is worth the price tag !                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "3374  perfect for gift for my 5 yr. old grandson! gave this to my grandson, along with  playing cards, as an easter gift. my grandson loved that his picture was plastered all over the cards and his family was depicted on the puzzle. (he thinks the easter bunny spied on him to take all of those pictures) i got the 252 piece puzzle due to his young age but i liked that there were many choices as far as number of pieces and designs to select from. the pieces are sturdy for little hands and the pieces fit together well, not like those cheap cardboard puzzles from the dollar store. the images are crisp and vivid just like all  products. the best part is, like all products offered by , it was easy to create. it took just a few minutes to select a design and the photos. i like that i could easily upload photos from google or use ones that i had stored in  from previous projects. it took me only minutes to make something that will last forever and will give great joy to my grandson for years to come. i am sure he will treasure it when he gets older and has kids of his own too.   \n",

      "4100  just buy it... i fell in love with good girl gone bad extreme after attending a kilian fragrance class at saks fifth avenue. i was able to experience all kilian fragrance's and this was  far the best in my opinion. i worked in fragrances and i've never smelled anything like it and you feel sexy and luxurious when you wear it. i receive so many compliments and a must-have for any date night, exclusive event, or perfect to just wear naked ;) it comes in a snake clutch which protects the gorgeous bottle inside that has beautiful snake and floral details. everything about this fragrance is sexy and a true gem if you are lucky to find it. if you don't believe me...it's soldout currently for a reason. i am proud to call this my signature scent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "5356  very relaxing scent and color! i really have been enjoying this bubble stick! and surprisingly i have already gotten at least 5 baths out of it and still have some left. and it does make a fair amount of bubbles. turns the water a greyish purple. and looks very relaxing. also smells very nice. it pairs well with any lavender bath salts or the pacifica bath tea packs. makes a great bath. if u want a bubble bar that is relaxing and colors the water some & ain't super overpowering with scent this is for u! i find it's very worth the money and u get a good bang for ur buck with all the baths u get out of it!!! it does leave some light purple residue on the bottom of my tub but comes off easily with a washcloth and water. or jus by rubbing my hand on it. doesn't stain skin or anything like that tho. i def recommend it! especially those people who r looking for something that is worth the price tag !                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
