      "4275    Pond's Perfection I received Ponds Lifting and brightening for free. I keep it on my night stand to use at night. I enjoyed that it is fragrance free, not sticky, light in texture, and that I saw results of hydrating my eye area. I will continue to use this product to see improvement on elasticity.

      "5410    Not the same quality I've had two comfortable pairs which lasted more than eight years.  This third pair has stiff strapping which is already fraying and actually make my feet achy.  Other website reviews mention the inferior foot bed, tight fit, and curiously no traditional @Teva trademark.  Something is not right and I dread putting these on.

      "5660    I like it but it's not my favorite! Pros: The consistency of this serum is different from other serums that I have used. It feels a little tacky at first but it soaks into the skin thereafter on light massaging. I usually apply just 2 drops for my entire face at night and wake up to velvety smooth even-looking skin in the morning. So in that way, its effective. I wouldnt use it during the daytime as I found the texture to be a little tacky compared to other very lightweight serums I have used before.  Cons: I doubt if its for sensitive skin. The fragrance is one of the ingredients and even though it's not as bad, it flares up my nose in the night and makes me sneeze in the morning. It also makes me tingle on application. I havent had any reactions so far, but I am not looking forward to using it every night but I use it 3 nights a week as I have highly sensitive skin and I would want my nose also to settle down with the smell.If you are okay with the smell and don't have sensitive skin, that's great because it works.I got this new skincare #complimentary from La Roche Posay and @influenster but reviews are my own.

      "6375    Excellent learning toy I received the Vtech Peppa Pig Learn & Discover Book and it is great. My little one loves peppa pig and was excited to get this and she plays with it for hours. Listens to it play music, read the book, listen to peppa, daddy pig, george and mommy pig plus she learns her abc's with it and she will say them over and over plus point at the pictures and says what letter and what they are.

      "11692   Not For My Skin! This clearing astringent is not for my skin! I have no acne issues and the ingredients in this product were too harsh for my skin. This product  made my eyes burn from swiping it past my under eyes. Alcohol is the 2nd ingredient on this list which makes me dislike this product! If youre someone with acne prone skin, this product might work great!

      "12081   Was ok @influenster sent me this mask to try along with another one from their line. I was a little unimpressed by this one. It did have a little cooling affect and that was nice. I didn't really notice a super drastic difference in my skin though. One thing I really disliked was after washing it off and using witch hazel it still left some residue on my skin so when I applied my moisturizer I got those annoying little balls of product coming off my skin. For the price point and how it performed I don't think I'll be getting this again.

Also the button holes are too small for the size of the buttons.  It's really difficult to button the Jacket, or unbutton it.  Hopefully that may get better as time goes on.

The smell reminds me of that salon conditioner, which I love!\\n@lorealhair @Influenster #EverPurePurple #EverPure #PurpleShampoo #complimentary txjewel196 undisclosed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
      "18785   The best car seat in the market! Graco products are totally impressive! We just love them all!\\r\\nWe just upgraded from Graco-Snugride @35 Lite car seat( plus , Graco car seat base) to Graco 4ever Extend2fit Platinum 4-in-1 Covertible car seat. Our baby loves them both! Both are made of high quality materials, easy to install, cushions are very helpful to help our little one keep him snug and comfortable in place. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are happy that we have upgraded the carseat to Extend2fit as it grows together with our little one.\\r\\nIt comes with a very generous support cushion and harness pads are pretty large which makes it perfect!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis car seat is a rear facing, forward facing, high back booster and backless booster, all in one! I can't wait until our little one grows older.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also has two cup holders which is extra bonus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best part of it- our 10 months old baby always falls sleep in the carseat which we love the most! It's one of the best car seat in the market! Thank you, Graco!

      "28157   herpes cure Using herbal natural remedy was what got me tested negative to HSV 2 after been diagnosed for years.I have spend so much funds on medications like acyclovir (Zovirax), Famciclovir (Famvir), and Valacyclovir (Valtrex). But it was all a waste of time and my symptoms got worst.  To me It is very bad what Big pharma are doing, why keep making humans suffer greatly just to get profits annually for medications that doesn't work.I'm glad that herbal remedies is gaining so much awareness and many people are getting off medications and activating their entire body system with natural herbal remedies and they are become holistically healed totally.

      "31246   I returned it!   3 pencils to a loop to fit 120. The good:  The case seemed nicely made and good quality.  The bad:  In order to use the case for 120 pencils you had to put 3 pencils in each loop which was, in my opinion, too tight.  It was possible but awkward to get 3 six-sided Albrecht Durer watercolor pencils in a loop, but I worried about breaking the tip while pushing in the \"third\" pencil.  Jerry's description should be clearer.  Technically this case holds 120 pencils, but not comfortably.  I think thicker pencils or round pencils would not work at all.  I love Jerry's and buy most of my supplies here.... but I replaced the case with one from Amazon.  Not as nice quality wise, but one loop per pencil.

      "31732   Not for dry, sensitive skin I was incredibly excited to receive this serum because it is the first time that I have used a Ponds anti-aging product. I started using the serum with very high hopes, however I have dry and sensitive skin and this made my skin even drier.

      "39581   Jes good GoogCovid: Nottingham to move into tier 3\\n\\n1 hour ago\\nSimon Bull\\nNottingham has consistently recorded one of the highest infection rates in England\\nNottingham and parts of the surrounding county will move into the top tier of Covid restrictions, it has been confirmed.\\n\\nPeople living in the city, along with Rushcliffe, Gedling and Broxtowe, face the toughest restrictions.\\n\\nThe measures come into force at one minute past midnight on Thursday and will expire after 28 days.\\n\\nIt comes after the city consistently recorded one of the highest infection rates in England.\\n\\nLatest updates: Nottingham facing 'very high' restrictions\\nThere are now 7.9 million people in England living in the tier three - the \"very high\" alert level.\\n\\nThis means pubs that do not serve substantial meals have to close, and there are further restrictions on households mixing.\\n\\nThe affected parts of Nottinghamshire join Liverpool City Region, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, South Yorkshire and Warrington in the highest tier.\\n\\nDetails of the lockdown will be formally announced on Tuesday, but in a joint statement local councils said the measures \"have been agreed to achieve a sustained reduction in infection rates\" and to \"protect our vulnerable residents, the NHS and social care services\".\\n\\nResidents and businesses who are affected will receive \"a package of support similar to those secured in other parts of the country\".\\n\\nThough it did have the highest figures in the UK earlier this month, Nottingham's seven-day rate of infection has dropped again, according to the latest data.\\n\\nThe city had the 24th highest rate of infection per 100,000 people in England, at 443.7, in the week up to the 23 October, down from 677.4 the previous week.\\n\\nIt is still the highest in the county, but the surrounding boroughs are all seeing an increase, with Broxtowe's infection rate having risen from 310.4 to 342.9, Gedling's up from 373.2 to 418.2 and Rushcliffe rising from 359.1 to 393.5.\\n\\n'Many more deaths'\\n\\nDavid Mellen, leader of Nottingham City Council, appealed to residents to \"work together\" and stick to \"very difficult\" restrictions.\\n\\nThough the seven-day infection rate for the city has dropped steadily after being the highest in the UK earlier this month, he said there were still concerns over rising rates among older age groups and hospital occupancy levels.\\n\\n\"We've got a growing number of people, way over 200 people, in our hospitals with Covid, and an increasing number in [intensive care units], so we are concerned about those numbers,\" he told BBC Radio Nottingham.\\n\\n\"Obviously we had many people die in Nottingham [and] Nottinghamshire earlier in the year and we don't want to add to that number with many more deaths as a result of this.\"\\n\\nMr Mellen also said the level of financial support from the government - which is to cover additional track and trace costs, enforcement and extra support to affected businesses - is \"not enough\".\\n\\nHe said he did not feel Nottingham had been \"fully funded by the government, and we do believe that if we do a really good job on track and trace, which is absolutely necessary, it will cost us more than what is being offered\".\\n\\n\"We tried to argue for more money, but the kind of formula that's been applied in four other [local] authority areas wasn't going to be changed for Nottingham and Nottinghamshire.\"\\n\\nYe Olde Salutation Inn\\nJason Weston from Ye Olde Salutation Inn said it was \"looking very, very dark\" for the pub\\nNottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood criticised the government for what she said was \"woeful\" communication over the move into the toughest restrictions.\\n\\n\"It's more than a week since Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock said they were talking to [Nottinghamshire] about going into tier three, yet talks didn't even begin until Thursday and MPs weren't even briefed until Friday,\" she tweeted.\\n\\nJason Weston, who runs Ye Olde Salutation Inn in the centre of Nottingham, said he will not have to close because the pub serves meals, but with capacity already down to 20% of what it was in summer because of the 22:00 curfew he said it was \"almost irrelevant\" whether they were allowed to open or not.\\n\\n\"I'm very worried,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We're watching the bank balance go down week by week - it's looking very, very dark.\"\\n\\nSOCIAL DISTANCING: What are the rules now?\\nSUPPORT BUBBLES: What are they and who can be in yours?\\nFACE MASKS: When do I need to wear one?\\nSCHOOLS: What will happen if children catch coronavirus?\\nTESTING: What tests are available?\\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "42501   Professional 600, is it really a pro? We have some sad news #notcovid19related our beloved @kitchenaid professional 600 mixer died last night #RIP. We were making a batch of #ryebread to go with our corned beef unfortunately we had to finish kneeding the dough by hand which is an arm workout on its own because the motor blew out, smoke and all the bad noises too. So we called #kitchenaid and after sitting on the phone for over an hour we finally got someone in #customerservice that was less then empathetic to our dilemma. We explained what happened and how frustrating the experience was. #kitchenaidcustomerservice told us that #kitchenaidmixers aren't meant for making dough, running more than 4 minutes, nor going over the speed of 2. Oh and they won't stand behind the mixer because they say making the bread and following the instructions is outside reasonable expectations for a KitchenAid Professional 600 mixer. If using the mixer to make dough is an incorrect use of the mixer when said mixer comes with a dough hook and can reach a speed of 10....\\r\\n\\r\\nSeems misleading to label a stand mixer professional 600 when it can not kneed dough. I found customer service was horrible. They implied making bread was improper use of the KitchenAid Professional 600 mixer. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you got this far and know of a mixer that stands up to more regular use and can handel making cake batter, cookies, and dough please let us know your suggestions.

      "46682   Smells nice. Goes on smooth I received this #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox for my honest review. \\r\\nI've been using degree deodorant for as long as I can remember. It is my go to brand for scents, price and doing the job. \\r\\nThis specific deodorant has a nice scent that isn't too overbearing, but you can Smell it when you start sweating. It goes on smooth and didn't leave any residue. It's a bigger stick than what I normally get but that means it will last longer! Overall I'm happy with this and happy to try it for free.

      "48475   A Fresh floral smell.... A Fresh floral smell. I dont smell a tea scent tbh. You only need 1 spritz. Its VERY strong & I like it better after its worn off a little bit. It lasts a very long time. There are 2 other scents in this collection, a wild rose & a vanilla orchid. Id love to see the differences in those scents.

      "49342   Just ok. Best for use... Just ok. Best for use in face, not for eyes. I bought it to remove eye makeup since my normal cleanser does a good job removing makeup. This claims its gentle enough to use on your eye lids, but it burns my eyes.

      "49789   Too small in cup size I wanted to use this bra for non-HIIT days but unfortunately it didn't work out. I bought a M which fit my ribcage (@36\") but my D cups were spilling out. I guess its back to the drawing board! I will guess that the bra is good, but if you have larger breasts-it won't work for you.

It fits loose and is super comfortable for the summer. bewoody@ymail.com Undisclosed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
      "51715   it completely sold I have very mixed feelings about this product. I feel like the detergent was reminiscent in scent and texture to that of regular dish detergent. Did it do the job in cleaning, yes. Could my own dish detergent do the same job, probably. Another thing that has me feeling off about this product is that my dishwasher started leaking during the use of this product. Idk if it was coincidence or that it actually made my dishwasher leak.  Either way, it was easy to use and I do think it cleaned well. Proof is in the before and after. I was given this product for free based on my honest review. #LemiShinexInfluenster #contest #complimentary @lemishine @influenster lngigliotti undisclosed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "52882   Universal Nectar! Love how the texture of this serum is balanced enough to not be uneventfully thin like water or have so much substance that it's tacky. I usually have either thin or thick serums for specific seasons and routines (nighttime vs daytime), but this one is universal enough to wear year round and any time of day, while providing hydration and bounce that perfect for a natural look, bedtime, or makeup prep. Also, my little bottle went a long way—just about 2 months of wear—so, while it'll set you back some pretty pennies, you'll get some bang fir your buck. If I were a beauty minimalist and had to reduce my stash to one primer at home or on vacation, this is the serum I'd recommend. Otherwise, as a beauty junkie, it doesn't quite compete with my favs from other brands to be my the top 5 product rotation, but it's up there, still. Wouldn't ordinarily reach for it, but grateful for the opportunity to try it—certainly gave me pause and opened my eyes to the brand.

      "63666   Typical Shampoo This shampoo had lots of suds and really made my hair feel clean. However, I did not feel that it did much than the typical natural@hair shampoo. The product also did cause seem stinging when it got into my eye which has not happened with other shampoos.

      "65294   The Bitten creamy... The Bitten creamy lemon poppy seed salad dressing is alright. This dressing is definitely not my favorite and I think the reason is that it has a strong lemon flavor. So I personally would not purchase this product myself, but I would recommend it for someone who doesnt mind lemon and likes poppy seed flavor.  #BittenxInfluenster #contest #complimentary @bittendressing @Influenster kailad19e7 undisclosed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
      "66191   5 stars so far I just started using this product and I like@how smooth it makes my skin feel. A little goes a long way. It moisturizes but doesnt make my skin feel clogged. Cant wait to see how my skin looks after a few weeks of use. ald18 undisclosed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
      "66266   This Dipbrow gel is... This Dipbrow gel is the best one I have used. It's long lasting, easy to use and creates fuller-looking, defined brows. I used this along with Anastasia tinted brow gel, BrowWiz pencil and stencils, it creates a perfect brow look everytime.\\nI can't say enough good things about this Brow Wiz. It was easy to use, precise detailing and the right shade.  \\n#ABHBrows #eyebrows #brows #contest #complimentary @anastasiabeverlyhills @Influenster \\n Anastasia Beverly Hills heatherk29 undisclosed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "69244   Shiseido Synchro Skin... Shiseido Synchro Skin Foundation is a powder foundation w/ medium to buildable full coverage. The first time I used this product I didnt use liquid foundation underneath and found a nice even coverage on my face. Throughout the day I noticed I didnt have to freshen up my face as it left my skin with a nice buttery finish. I prefer to use this powder on its own as I felt like when I put it on top of liquid foundation for a full coverage look, it looked to heavy. I definitely will recommend this product to others and I will most likely purchase this product on my own. @influenster @shiseido\\n#complimentary #influenster #shiseido #synchroskin #makeup #glamXaL glamxal undisclosed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "70495   Nice heavy duty product Swan 50' Contractor is a very reliable product. This product is very bright and vibrant in color. The product feels very well made and has a noticeable thickness as well as strongness about it. The product was very easy to install twisted on very easy and I had no issue with any leaking and water pressure was perfect. I love that this product can reach from the front of my home to my backyard I am able to water the grass, wash my car, water my plants/grass and fill up pale of water for my animals. The water comes out very clean and gently. The product is very heavy duty and is a bit stiff but I feel overtime with uses and this Texas sun will soften the stiffness out. This product does tangle at times and you do have to be patient to unwhirl it. I think this product is perfect for my weather and will last many years. This product fits great on my home and is easy to store. This product is a bit bulky but well worth the quality. The color is a bright red color with a black line looks to be very modern.

      "74753   Good product I like this product, but not as much as the other products from the same campaign.  I didn't like the smell. Makes me feel that has bad chemicals on it. Is really strong.

      "76556   Loved this product! Need to buy more shades I'm super pleased with seeing this lipstick being cruelty free & vegan. The cold pressed fruit oils DEFINITELY make a very hydrating formula for your lips, no cracking or cakey-ness when it's on your lips! This is one product however you do have to wait a short amount of time before eating or drinking, because there is slight color transfer until it's \"set\". While you will have to reapply it here & there, it does leave a slight tint on your lips, giving you another layer of depth in between touch ups.

      "77715   This WALL PLUG HEATER is good at SOME things... This item was no where near what I thought it was going to be, with that being said pay close attention to the details. If you are looking for something tiny to plug under your desk @work/home this would be perfect. However if you are looking for something slightly bigger to heat an actual medium/mid-large room this is probably not what you are looking for, unless you just want to MAYBE take the edge off while sitting in front of it. I did not realize it was a wall plug heater. Now I do have it plugged up rt now and I'm sitting in front of it and it really wants to take the chill off of me and it's trying hard to do so. I would recommend this for those who want to warm a small room over a little time (30 or so min.) or continue warmness in a medium room. Not at all a bad buy IF you know what you are buying and if not you can put it to use somewhere you didn't know you needed one, like the bathroom . In the photos I tried to make it so you could compare the size. Good Luck OH! and Walmart was really nice about it when I tried to return it so there is that, and if I was going to mistakingly buy this I'm glad I did it @ walmart. com Thanks!

      "79068   Amazing scent- works so well ving the scent if lavender and almond oil. Almond oil is one of my favorites! \\nI used this on my daughters hair 1st, he hair tends to get frizzy and tangled real fast.  After using this on her head, he hair was so smooth, and had no frizz, it was also tangle free.  Loved this stuff! \\nThis was sent to my by #complementary from @Influenster to try out and give a #review. \\n#suave #haircare alliebabee undisclosed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

      "81743   Didn't work for me, but worked for my husband I tried using this for a month, did not noticed any brightening effect. Instead, I noticed small bumps on my face. I never had any issues on brightening cleanser the same as the reaction I got from this. I stopped using it and the bumps disappeared. Now, I didnt want the product to go wasted so I had my husband use it as a daily cleanser. And yes, I noticed his facial complexion have improved. Thus, the 3 star rating😊.

I highly recommend this product. lcoto17 undisclosed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
      "82651   Eye cream goals! This eye cream has really surprised me! It's very gentle and doesn't cause me any discomfort, and I have definitely seen a lovely difference in the skin around my eyes. It's not cruelty-free which breaks my heart, but this little tube will last me a long time.

      "85553   I have tried this... I have tried this product before and I am@very happy with it. It has a very nice and fresh scent. It leaves my clothes looking good and it helps maintain the whiteness of my clothes. I have a lot of white clothes and blankets and this works perfectly. I would recommend it! jaineilyo undisclosed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
      "85862   Perfect for small spaces- @wifeonadime Small space friendly! Amazing deal for such nice furniture. Love that the cushions have zip covers that can be thrown in the washer. The furniture is a very dark brown but still works with my black gazebo. The chairs are plenty wide but i will say that the loveseat in not as deep as I'd like.

      "86727   Glowing legs This applied so smooth and was easy to use. I immediately had great results and felt glowy. I like to use this for special occasions, I love this leg mask but not enough to do it weekly lol. It's a beauty must have for when you want to be smoother and a little extra!

The only problem is that the mask is very tight and it's very uncomfortable to breathe even though I ordered large size in adults Patty@texas undisclosed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "90720   Both good and bad Hi, I ordered this doorbell.  It rings when no one is at my door. I live in a mobile park and could it be ringing from some one else's door, as I noticed in the small print pamphlet that it can ring up to 1000 ft.  Also I put one at the front and back door, can't get then to ring different tones.  Read the directions..\\nAny suggestions??

      "94600   HORRIBLE - Pulled my hair out! I have long straight hair.  The warm up time was good, cute design but simply did not work well.  My hair would roll up (not down) very fast getting caught and then there is no release button so the only way you can get the hair out was to pull it out, breaking my hair.  Luckily, I was smart enough to turn off while pulling my hair out or it would have burned my hair too.  I am returning to the store as I would have to pay the postage for the return.  Would not recommend and due to Covid 19, if they make you pay for the return of a bad product, I would not use the company again.

      "95780   New Home/ Wash Appliance This dishwasher came with our new build. It is nice but I was hoping to have similar features I was use to in my old house/ washer. This washer does not dry well. Most of the dishes come out wet and I end up having to air dry before unloading. It says it has a dryer but it I don't think it drys. amyers777@hotmail.com Pataskala                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
      "96927   Amazing remover Normally I just use the @soapandgloryusa Micellar to clean off my eye makeup. Today I tried the Puffy Eye Attack eye make-up remover. Worked like a charm! Results are one pad per eye, and the third was just a cleansing wipe for the rest of my face with Micellar. I only did my eyes going out, no foundation. Biggest surprise? Mascara wiping right off! Thanks @bzzagent for sending it!\\n\\n#ad #bzzagent #soapandglory #puffyeyeattackmakeupremover #oneswipegone #bzzreview April1 Fl                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
      "97982   Don't Waste Your Money or Time on This SCAM! We rescued a puppy that had been dumped in a creek. I bought the DNAffirm Dog Breed Test to find out what kind of dog she was.  I ordered the kit from Walmart. I sent in my dogs DNA sample on 7/24/20 for the Canine Breed Determination Test. The info paperwork that came with it said \"receive results in 1-2 weeks after DNA sample received\".  On 08/10/20 I sent an e-mail to info@accu-metrics.com (website contact) asking what was taking so long, as I hadn't received my results and their website (results.accu-metrics.com/) showed only that I had registered, but they hadn't received the DNA sample yet. I received an email back from caninedna.labtestgroup@gmail.com saying:  \"Your test is in the queue for processing.  Currently our supplier of scientific reagents is experiencing a delay in their manufacturing process due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Unfortunately, this delay has created a shortage of critical reagents used by our scientists in our DNA testing facility and will result in a delay in processing your order. We are working closely with our supplier at resolving this issue and they have assured us that a substantial quantity of reagents designated for Canine Breed Determination testing will be made available in the weeks to come.  As a thank you for your understanding and in support of Covid-19 research allocation requirements by our manufacturing facility we would like to send you the Canine Health Guard at home clinical health test for your pet free of charge. If you are interested in ordering a free Canine Health Guard at home test as our thank you please email us a response with your mailing address.\"  So, I sent them the requested info for the free test kit. It's been nearly two months since I sent in my dog's DNA sample. I haven't received my DNA Results or the Free test they promised. In fact, I haven't heard any response at all. Now, when I tried to e-mail them, it was returned with \"could not be delivered\" failure message. So frustrating and ridiculous.  What a waste of money and time!  Scam.

      "99651   I received a... I received a complimentary full sized bottle of Bitten dressing in the flavor Lime Avocado. Im not usually a fan of avocado, but I loved the flavor of this! Its mostly lime flavored and perfectly complimented my fajitas. I would definitely buy this when I run out. I only wish it was easier to get out of the glass bottle. Anticipation indeed.

      "101421  So Fresh! This Kylie eye cream is amazing. I keep mine in the fridge to give a nice cooling sensation under the eyes. I use it on myself (26) and my mom (55) every morning and it has quickly become a staple in our routine. Thank you @kyliejenner and @kylieskin!
