      "951    I thoroughly enjoy the weight and pointability of this 16\" barreled Ruger in 300 BLK. However, not only was the action very rough from the onset, but one could not cycle the action over an empty magazine due to the mag keeper physically blocking the bolt! (Note - I love P-mags in my AR platforms, but the Ruger factory issued 5.56 cal P-mag delivered with this .300 BLK Ruger rifle was the cause of the \"rough action!) ... I purchased and installed an after-market, METAL, 10 round, 300 BLK  (7.62x 39)  \"ASC brand\" magazine and this solved both problems. The bolt cycled noticeably smoother with the ASC magazine, plus i could now easily close the bolt over an empty mag. The difference this magazine swap made with the rifle's functionality is amazing. This was an inexpensive fix and saved me from selling my newly acquired Ruger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "1804   I have been through numerous flat irons (from $29.00 up to $300 brands) and they all ended up making my hair smell burned.  Since I have very thick, wavy hair I have to put it on the highest settings.  Still, I have to pass it through so many times that my wrist ends up cramping way before I'm done!  This one works on the first pass and with no burning smell.  So glad I took the chance and bought it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "3590   I received a 0.17 oz tube from a friend about 7 months ago and I'll get easily another month out of it! I'm here to reorder (cannot bear the idea of running out!) the full size, and one for a friend.\\nI have tried dozens of shadow primers, and until I used this product, I had no idea what a primer COULD and SHOULD do. It's a thicker formula than I've ever tried - I \"pat\" in on gently before smoothing it out. Women have asked me how I keep my eyeshadow perfect all day, no matter if I'm sweating, at work, or up all night....and I'm more than happy to tell! I have actually gone THREE days/2 (sleeping) nights (don't ask), and while the rest of my makeup looked worn out, my eyes looked GREAT!\\n\\nI'll be sure to add photos later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "3707   From the similar to exactly similar bath bombs I've seen of a rainbow/rainbow with cloud bath bombs is that while it fizzes the beautiful colors display in the tub in the short time it completes its \"fizz.\" This particular bath bomb fizzed with no visual beauty, or color. I wouldn't pay 25 cents for this bath bomb, more less $8.00.

      "4669   I'd been waiting for this jacket to go on sale & ordered a medium on 11/15 when it went on sale for $71.40. Received an email on 11/17 that the order was fulfilled & had shipped but I NEVER RECEIVED, I was refunded though. When I checked online it showed there were 5 small left in stock, so I called Lucky Brand to order in that size but was told even though the website reflected that, it was actually out of stock. Not the first time this has happened to me from this company, apparently inventory control & customer service isn't of importance anymore!

      "5445   Ok, so let me go ahead and say I'm going to \"water off\" people out there (i.e. hunters and competition shooters). I have been handloading my ammo for 39 years.  Started in in 1980.  Didn't know much then, I had a Lee Loader in .44 magnum, .45-70, and .30-30.  You guys that get free coffee at Hardees know what a Lee Loader is.  Back then I used to load Sierra Matchkings for my Remington model 788 in .30-30, not because they shot good (which they did) but because I like the way they looked.  Since that time I have owned hundreds of rifles in a lot of calibers and I always go back to Sierra Matchking bullets \"IF\" I want to know what a rifle is capable of.  I just had take a refresher course on that.  I purchased 2 boxes of 142 grain Accubonds, and a box of 143 grain ELD-X bullets, working up a load for my 6.5 Creedmoor.  I was disappointed to see that my RCBS dies slightly damaged the Accubonds and Eld-X bullets.  To my dismay, I spent $192.00 on Redding Competition dies and a VLD bullet seater.  Needless to say, I was not completely satisfied with the accuracy results.  In an act of desperation, I grabbed a box of 140 grain Sierra Matchking bullets, a pound of R19 powder, as H4350 is no where to be found, and began working up a load following online Sierra load data.  The end result was an outstanding group at 300 yards with R19 and Sierra 140 grain Matchking bullets.  Furthermore, I worked up a load with the Accubonds and it wouldn't come close to the SMK's in \"My Ruger Precision Rifle\".  And now to \"Water off\" the rest of the bunch.  I've been hunting with Sierra Matchking bullets for years and never lost a whitetail to this day.  Would I shoot elk, or bear with one?  Probably not, but I have never lost a deer yet that I've shot with a SMK.  Matter of fact, killed 3 this year and all fell in their tracks.  So take this bit of advise, before you waste powder, primers, bullets, AND money, just see what your rifle is \"Capable of\" with SMK's.   \n",

      "6418   I have been looking for this color story in an affordable palette for a while. After reading the reviews & watching some YouTube videos & reviews on the Nudist palette I decided to get it during a BOGO sale & using the $3.50 coupon. It is definitely worth full price. The dark colors are so blendable, and pigmented. I created a beautiful eye look in less than 5 mins. It works better than a lot of my more expensive palettes. I did have to reach into my singles for a lid shade. The shimmers didn't have enough pop for the look I was going for, but good enough for every day looks. I would recommend this palette, for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
      "6537   Website clearly states \"free gift with purchase\", however according to \"customer service\", the threshold to receive the free gift is $139.99 and this item is $139.95.

      "6559   The rating should be a 4.5 or 4.75, but such subtleties are not allowed. This is my fourth pair of Invincibles in as many years and the first pair, except for some sun fading, is still very serviceable. The fit is comfortable, the length provides coverage without restriction and the built in brief provides just the right amount of support.    The side pockets are very handy for carrying a number of items, in my case, an iphone as I listen to podcasts when I walk.  The side pockets are the one feature that prevents me from giving these shorts the best score. On the older model shorts, the side pockets allow about an 1\" or 1.5\" of the phone to protrude above the pocket, so the phone was secure, but also easy to extract if the need arose. On the newer models, the pocket envelops the whole phone and the strength of the velcro plus having to \"fish\" for the phone makes it more difficult to extract.  This is, to be sure, a minor issue, and will not deter me from ordering another pair in the near future as these are my go to shorts anytime the temperature is above 45 degrees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "7587   I purchased this blazer on October 10, on SALE for 39.99 and with my promo coupon, paid 33.99 for it. It has no buttons but that can easily be fixed if you want to spend a few more bucks. It goes great with jeans. PROBLEM -- It troubles me when I decided to log in on the Sunday after Black Friday and go surfing the Clearance section to see what I can purchase and come across this exact same blazer being sold for $59.98. WHAT IS THAT? THAT IS PRICE GOUGING!

I emailed multiple times but no one ever answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "9878   I had two items that missed the delivery date and was assured I would receive 150 dollars plus 10 percent off the purchase.  My purchase order invoice was over 3000.00.  Because no other information was given I anticipated an approximate amount of 450.00.  I got told at the end of delivery under half that amount and then was hung up on.

      "11011  I bought this for a gift.  It was WAY too small (same size I had bought in other styles).  I paid EXTRA $$ to have it arrive on time for a birthday gift (2-day shipping) and it arrived 7 days afterwards.  When I exchanged it to get the proper size and have it shipped directly to my sister, they treated it as a return and deducted $5.00 from the purchase price plus all the extra shipping I paid.  In the end I was out $15.  I will never purchase another item from this vendor.

      "11522  I love Oakley sunglasses, and haven't owned any in about 30 years cause they are so expensive.When Midway USA had this special for $54.00 I jumped on it and bought me and my wife a pair. My wife had never owned a pair of Oakley's , and would never pay even $54.00 for a pair , so I surprised her with them and she loves them .Thanks Larry Potterfield for the sale price ,  Mick & Karen Hartgrove                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
      "11614  I was forced to buy this cutter after purchasing Midsouth's once fired 6.5mm Creedmoor brass.  All the brass was longer than the overall case length size of 1.920\".  That said I have used the 3 in 1 for 22 caliber, 6mm, and 30 caliber cases.  It is an outstanding product.  With trimming and chamfering both the outside and the inside of the case at the same time it saves much effort and time in case preparation.  Of course a Forster case trimmer is required.  I have a Forster attachment to the trimmer that allows me to use my hand drill to automate the process and save my hand.  For trimming many lengthened cases I would not be without it.  I also pick up range brass in 5.56 and the cases most always exceed the maximum case length.  Processing hundreds of cases is an easy chore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "11644  I kind of balked a little at the price at first. I mean who spends 140.00 on a pillow even an organic one??  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this pillow and it is absolutely the best one I have ever owned. I hope it isn't like most pillows and. Weds to be replaced after a year or two because that would be cost prohibitive but absolutely worth it if it lasts for awhile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "14067  Very sharp boot- ordered both black and brown when they were on sale for $80.  But still not sure I received such a great deal, and would prefer if they were a bit taller, and hit mid knee which is a more flattering height.  With all that said, they are extremely comfortable with a nice rubber sole that adds to that comfort.  The heel shape is great too-larger which adds to walking stability and creates a more casual look. I'll wear these for many years to come.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because I prefer if they were longer which is a more flattering look, and I would have preferred paying a lower price than the 79.95 final sale from Dillards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

The legs which were missing and not listed on the parts list or instructions came a day later. If I want to assemble furniture, I'll buy it from Ikea. I didn't expect to have to assemble a 600.00 sideboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "15520  We bought this sectional sofa four months ago. We also purchased the ottoman and the recliner with it and it is awful quality! It has ripped in several places. Not just the sofa but the ottoman and the recliner. Terrible product! It shouldn't even be sold! We spent $1200.00 on everything and if you make a purchase that big and especially it being furniture for your living room it should not tear up in four months! I wish I had my money back and I could get something else that is better quality! Very dissatisfied! DO NOT GET THIS!!! I had also ordered everything and when I got to the store they had sold my recliner to someone else so we ended up having to get the one on the floor which was the last one they had! My opinion we should be able to take it back and show them how bad it has torn apart and they should refund our money or let us pick anything else out that we want! I'm not even going to mention how many times we had to return to the store after we got home and parts were missing and the first one we bought we came home set everything up only to find that there was a RIP in the one we brought home from the store so we went back and they gave us a new one and four months later it's tearing up everywhere!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "16455  Using daily at least.  Had it since about Jan of this year.  I purchased at Dollar General in Bellville, TX.  It didn't work this morning at all, so I assumed I used up the batteries.  Changed same noting the correct position, and still does not come on, make a noise, nothing.  I am so angry.  Yes I only paid $7.50 but I could have bought a lot more batteries for that amount.  I really think I should at least be able to send in and get a new one, in exchange.  This is another typical reason why we should start paying attention to all the Chinese products.  And Dollar General would not exist if it had to use products made in USA or other acceptable countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
      "16749  One star so it stands out.. please read! \\nSo Samsung wasn't my first choice nor was Brandsmart. Samsung because of their reputation in recent years and Brandsmart because of their extended warranty issues in the past and their vendors.. let's see fingers crossed. \\nHowever, Brandsmart had THE BEST price in town. Brandsmarts' deal was sooo good I couldn't pass the Samsung's. I really got a great deal. Paid $1199.99 for the set. PLUS warranty and a couple of other things (hoses, etc).\\nPros: They're spectacular thus far. This model is loaded with features. FYI the washer DOES have a drum light but only on the 5.0 cu ft not the 4.5 cu ft. Only had these units a couple of weeks so we'll see if they stand the test of time. \\nCons: 1) YOU HAVE TO BUY the WiFi Samsung - Universal Smart Home Adapter\\nModel:HD2018GH ($25 each) to enjoy the alert features and so on. You can ONLY control the units if you press a specific button on the machine each time which defeats the purpose since you're already there to press it yourself. You CAN however monitor the units regardless without pressing any buttons..which I have to say saves time because you exactly when your load is done..\\n2) Setting up the WiFi was a major pain in the BUTT! I'm lucky that I do IT and was able to figure it out. Basically, you separate your 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.. so no band-steering on your router if you want these to work. They ONLY connect to 2.4 GHz.. make sure your network has different names on those frequencies so you're able to connect them. \\n\\nNote: If the washer makes a lot of noise on the spin cycle try adjusting the little rubber legs. Height, etc. It was really loud here and I was able to adjust reducing the noise almost to nothing. \\n\\nI must say Brandsmart lowered their price on this set and getting the credit adjusted was a breeze. I'm very happy with them so far and this entire process.                                                                                     \n",
      "16841  I have 2 Kimber 84L rifles and this shoots cloverleaf groups out of both of them, easily 3/4\" groups out of several different boxes.  Plus, keep your brass because if you decide to load later it'll save you $1.50/shot for Nosler brass (yes, I know its not the exact same but Nosler customer support says its close).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "17625  Very well made range bag. Everything about it is well made and heavy -duty. Just the right size for 3 or 4 handguns, plus everything else you need for a day of fun & games. The zippers are the best , handles and shoulder strap are comfortable and sturdy. This bag is built to last, well designed, and easy to carry. I paid $25.00 less for this bag @ ZORO than it was priced at the local gun store.

      "17852  I'm a bit disappointed in my first time trying NB shoes ever. I found this shoe looking fit latest best shoes for overpronation. Loved this color so I went with it. My toes were scrunched right up in the front of the shoe. I don't have an abnormally long toe or anything like that. I usually wear size 10, but this shoe is more like 9.75. I'm unsure if going a half size up would keep my same foot alignment/support where I need for overpronation.  The toe region also oddly seems to be missing support? Feels like there's no material between my toes and the ground, maybe some people like that, I don't.

      "18566  The Stamina Cutbacks that I recently purchased are only going to be used for casual wear.  Previous Stamina Cutbacks that I have purchased at retail stores where comfortable and I need a sneaker that is a wide fit.  However, it seems that the insoles do not have sufficient arch support so that I need to purchase a orthopedic grade insole that gives such support which adds another $50.00 to be able to wear the sneaker in complete comfort.  Also, if used for jogging the sneaker's tread wears out too fast in the heal area while the rest of the Stamina Cutback sneaker is still like new.   I put duck tape on the heel when it starts to wear down the black tread flat and starts to show the underneath white portion to get a little more life out of the sneaker since the rest is still like new.  I like the style and fit but they do not last long for running or jogging and need more arch support even though they are categorized as an athletic sneaker.  I only purchase them when on sale as I need to also purchase a better insole and the tread does not last long when used for jogging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
      "18694  Previous year I had purchased a full set of tires that cost over $750.00 &#40;GoodYear&#41;, I had nothing but flat ties and each time I had to get it patch. After complaining of tires purchased and salesperson said I needed new tires, I then informed him I had just purchased them last year and according to what he life of tires was 65k miles and I only had 25k miles. Sales representative told me that tires I purchased were defective and that he would give me credit for new ones. So, I proceeded to get new set of different brands of tires, giving the benefit of the doubt it was a defect.  This visit I went in for a flat tire, salesperson stated that my tires need to be replaced because they were at 4/32. Salesperson check miles when new tires were purchase back January 2019 and the life of tires purchased were 65k miles and compared to what miles I had was only 23k miles. How is this company/ tire name promising x miles and life of tires and they are not living up to it? He said they would give me credit to purchase new tire.

      "19902  Like another customer, I had my doubts about the quality of this jacket. For $79.00, I was willing to take a chance. Boy was I wrong. The workmanship and fit were perfect. It could easily pass for something costing 4-5 times as much.

      "21216  When I turned 35 years old, my lips started to get very dry. I was getting desperate because the cracks I had were painful, my lip skin was falling apart, UGH! Horrible! It made me feel down and sad. My lips  looked so horrible like if they were part of a horror movie. I used everything! From cheap lip moisturizers to expensive ones (over $ 20.00). Then when getting my favorite toner from Mamonde, I saw they had this in the Grab and Go at my local Ulta Store. I love Mamonde and so I gave it a try... and O.M.G.!!!\\n\\nIt was amazing!!! At first I felt my lips a bit tingled but in less than three days my lips looked healthy, smooth and hydrated!!! I use this lip balm from morning to night. \\n\\nWhen I start my morning skin care routine I apply the balm at the end step of my hydration process (before applying makeup/lipstick), after I remove my makeup/cleansing skin care routine and before going to bed. It last a lot, the glossy effect is something I love too, you can put any lippie on top of it, or use any lipstick to give it a tint. Or just go with the natural gloss of it.\\n\\nI have used it for over 4 weeks and still have good amount of product. The price is right for the results I got, and will continue to use it. Thank you Mamonde for this wonderful lip balm!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "23246  You want $54.99 full price, then $24.99 for discount then when I purchased it, it was on clearance for $15.94 & thank god for that bc its not worth more than $10 its so cheap feeling, thin and really isnt anything more than fashion wear since its NOT insulated. Walmart and Target have cheaper priced and better quality brands! Everyone save urself the trouble and money. The only mildly okay thing with this vest is its true to size, maybe with a little wiggle room as its considered 'outdoor wear'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "23257  My daughter really liked that socks go up on the calf & stay up. Most \"slipper-type\" socks slide down & get bunched. Tho calf elastic could be a little tight for some girls over age 13 or 125 lbs.  I bought 8 pair of the socks in Christmas designs as small gift for nieces.

      "24167  I received a full size jar of Renergie Lift Multi-action Ultra Face Cream With SPF 30 to try for my honest review. I tried the cream for 2 weeks, applying in the morning and before bed. It really left my skin feeling silky smooth. I did not see much difference in tightening on my face, but did see an improvment on my neck...after losing 20lbs the skin was lose and looked tired. This really helped in that area. I liked the smell as well. The only down side is the price. If this was 50.00 or less I would buy it on a regular basis....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "25242  I have dress coats for church and community events, but I needed something for casual and sporty that was really warm for northern Michigan.  Wore it yesterday when the temperature downstate dropped from 48 to 22 degrees. I was snug as a bug...a very warm bug.  Runs a bit large, but good for sweaters underneath.  Love the tie belt and adjustable cuffs.  Similar jackets here are well over $100.00.

PS GOOD quality...too bad they don't fit and they cost too much to return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "26322  I thought this was an awesome deal for $2.99 and had bought myself a a total of 5 of these frames in different colors.  I was going to buy one as a gift for a friend.  But when I removed the plastic wrap, I saw small indent or bubble imperfections in a couple of them.  I did not or could not see those imperfections through the plastic wrap or I would not have purchased them.  Luckily, of the ones I kept and am using, they sit on a shelf where people cannot get too close and hopefully will never notice the glass imperfections.  But I would have been embarrassed if one I gave as a gift had the same imperfection.  Overall, still a decent frame for a situation like mine and for the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
      "26422  Before even getting this paid off, it is unraveling!! Very cheap materials and very cheaply made. I purchased it for my room,  the smaller rugs are used in the hall and the kitchen. I'm not sure about removing stains but as it is falling apart now, it will be trashed soon enough.Wearing high heels, playing games on it or having a pet in the home... forget these rugs! $134.00 total and 2 months old? What a waste of money 😭😭😭... Also, since it is made of cheap plastic polyester type material, DO NOT USE around open flames! I am sure it would melt easily!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "26876  Reorder #70-008, dimensions 3\"x6.25\".  For decades I have used this pocket calendar, with a black leather cover, address book insert and blank pad insert.  The store from which I bought inserts yearly lost its lease.  Office Depot has no refills and I cannot find anyone who sells them.  I should not have to buy a whole new product every year;  I just the insert(s)!

      "27522  We had a derecho (A line of intense, widespread, and fast-moving windstorms and sometimes thunderstorms that moves across a great distance and is characterized by damaging winds.) in eastern Iowa on 08/10/2020. Chain saws were hard to find. I found this at Ace Hardware. They had one left and delivered it to my truck curbside. Great people to do business with. We used it quite a bit at first but had to get a saw with 26\" bar. Unfortunately the chain adjuster on 16\" Craftsman is not like the older saws. It is a slotted head shaft with a gear at the end. That gear turns a geared head on what I would call the screw that turns the boss that tightens the bar. It would eventually strip both gears enough that you could not tighten the chain and bar. This \"Rube Goldberg\" design makes tightening the chain a chore. Instead of a straight screw and a boss to tighten the chain we have a 90 degree gear and pinion that get worn and sloppy. Said gear and pinion tightener is not sold separately. You have to replace the entire clutch assembly. I ordered one on 12/21/2020 from MTD Parts as MTD makes the saw for Craftsman $254.07 shipped to my door but the part is back ordered until the last week in January! Who thought and engineered  this foolish chain adjuster? Probably the same team who came up with \"New Coke Coca Cola.\" Now I gotta go refill my wind bag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "28487  I got these on sale, so this review is based on paying $1.25 per mask. These are triple layer, which is what the CDC is recommended for cloth face masks now (December 2020), so that's nice. The fabric options are also great, and the adjustable ear loops are handy. I will say these are HUGE. They cover above the nose basically down to the neck, which is good for coverage, but kind of annoying on my face. I bought the kid size, too, and they still cover my nose and mouth just fine, so a size in between would be great. I have not washed yet, though, and other reviews say they shrink. I typically handwash masks, though. The addition of a metal nose piece would help immensely, but again, these were super cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "29274  I paid extra to purchase preaddressed envelopes to go with our Christmas cards this year. I received 60 envelopes that were preaddressed with someone else's name and address. When I contacted customer service I was informed that they would not replace the envelopes with corrected ones. The only recourse I was offered was a promo code for the purchase of preaddressed envelopes. You cannot purchase envelopes on their own through Shutterfly. They are only available as an add on to a card purchase. In addition, my promo code expires within the month so I can't even apply towards a future card purchase. So I paid roughly $100 for custom printed cards and envelopes that arrived incorrect and then I was informed that my only option was to buy a new set of cards with new envelopes and Shutterfly would cover the $17.40 cost for addressing those new envelopes, but not the $81 for the cards (which in reality would have been far higher because I used a now expired coupon code for 40% off). I will no longer be a Shutterfly customer after this experience. I have used this service for over 10 years for everything from Christmas cards to my wedding albums. My customer service experience this holiday season left me disappointed, angry, and having to scramble to find envelopes that matched in size and color somewhere else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "29947  So I purchased a few items on 11/19, and now these jeans are $11.17 less than the price I paid. I chatted with someone at Duluth and was told since more than 7 days has passed and I already received them at a sales price back on 11/19, there was nothing they could do. Is it just me, or should they honor the lowered price three weeks later? I am now about to jump into my truck and return not just the unworn pair of jeans, but the unworn jacket I purchased on 11/19, and go shopping for another brand and product.

      "31177  I ordered a Singer Patchwork Sewing and QUILTING Machine, you sent a regular Sewing Machine. Your ad has both items listed by side. You emailed the order confirmation at once. It took 3 days  and 2 emails from me to obtain delivery date and tracking number. The product arrived, but you sent the wrong item. I requested a shipping label from you, after 2 more requests without a word from you , I decided to return the product back to you and paid out of pocket $30.70 to ship it back to you. The shipping label arrived too late! I got multiple excuses from you and always suggesting that the fault was on my behalf. Please refer to emails to confirm my statements. I have been reimbursed $199.99 , but the $30.70 is still unpaid. I believe that singer should pay this amount to me immediately. My experience dealing with Singer has been overwhelmingly painful and expensive, yes, $30.70 worth.  My pride and purse attest witness to that. In case you decide to pay me back my address is Myra Fresquez PO Box 1801 Guymon Oklahoma 73942                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "951    Good rifle / poor magazine fit - Problem Solved! I thoroughly enjoy the weight and pointability of this 16\" barreled Ruger in 300 BLK. However, not only was the action very rough from the onset, but one could not cycle the action over an empty magazine due to the mag keeper physically blocking the bolt! (Note - I love P-mags in my AR platforms, but the Ruger factory issued 5.56 cal P-mag delivered with this .300 BLK Ruger rifle was the cause of the \"rough action!) ... I purchased and installed an after-market, METAL, 10 round, 300 BLK  (7.62x 39)  \"ASC brand\" magazine and this solved both problems. The bolt cycled noticeably smoother with the ASC magazine, plus i could now easily close the bolt over an empty mag. The difference this magazine swap made with the rifle's functionality is amazing. This was an inexpensive fix and saved me from selling my newly acquired Ruger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "1804   Does what it says! I have been through numerous flat irons (from $29.00 up to $300 brands) and they all ended up making my hair smell burned.  Since I have very thick, wavy hair I have to put it on the highest settings.  Still, I have to pass it through so many times that my wrist ends up cramping way before I'm done!  This one works on the first pass and with no burning smell.  So glad I took the chance and bought it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "3590   LIFE CHANGER (for your eyes, anyway!) I received a 0.17 oz tube from a friend about 7 months ago and I'll get easily another month out of it! I'm here to reorder (cannot bear the idea of running out!) the full size, and one for a friend.\\nI have tried dozens of shadow primers, and until I used this product, I had no idea what a primer COULD and SHOULD do. It's a thicker formula than I've ever tried - I \"pat\" in on gently before smoothing it out. Women have asked me how I keep my eyeshadow perfect all day, no matter if I'm sweating, at work, or up all night....and I'm more than happy to tell! I have actually gone THREE days/2 (sleeping) nights (don't ask), and while the rest of my makeup looked worn out, my eyes looked GREAT!\\n\\nI'll be sure to add photos later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "3707   Boring, Doesn't Provide Colors for Bath From the similar to exactly similar bath bombs I've seen of a rainbow/rainbow with cloud bath bombs is that while it fizzes the beautiful colors display in the tub in the short time it completes its \"fizz.\" This particular bath bomb fizzed with no visual beauty, or color. I wouldn't pay 25 cents for this bath bomb, more less $8.00.

Went to use it without any spray or oils and everything stuck to it!!!!!!!! Freaking junk and totally unhappy with it. $210.00 for junk. We are going to ask to return it and get my money back.

      "4669   DISAPPOINTED with Lucky Brand I'd been waiting for this jacket to go on sale & ordered a medium on 11/15 when it went on sale for $71.40. Received an email on 11/17 that the order was fulfilled & had shipped but I NEVER RECEIVED, I was refunded though. When I checked online it showed there were 5 small left in stock, so I called Lucky Brand to order in that size but was told even though the website reflected that, it was actually out of stock. Not the first time this has happened to me from this company, apparently inventory control & customer service isn't of importance anymore!

      "5445   Absolutely would buy again Ok, so let me go ahead and say I'm going to \"water off\" people out there (i.e. hunters and competition shooters). I have been handloading my ammo for 39 years.  Started in in 1980.  Didn't know much then, I had a Lee Loader in .44 magnum, .45-70, and .30-30.  You guys that get free coffee at Hardees know what a Lee Loader is.  Back then I used to load Sierra Matchkings for my Remington model 788 in .30-30, not because they shot good (which they did) but because I like the way they looked.  Since that time I have owned hundreds of rifles in a lot of calibers and I always go back to Sierra Matchking bullets \"IF\" I want to know what a rifle is capable of.  I just had take a refresher course on that.  I purchased 2 boxes of 142 grain Accubonds, and a box of 143 grain ELD-X bullets, working up a load for my 6.5 Creedmoor.  I was disappointed to see that my RCBS dies slightly damaged the Accubonds and Eld-X bullets.  To my dismay, I spent $192.00 on Redding Competition dies and a VLD bullet seater.  Needless to say, I was not completely satisfied with the accuracy results.  In an act of desperation, I grabbed a box of 140 grain Sierra Matchking bullets, a pound of R19 powder, as H4350 is no where to be found, and began working up a load following online Sierra load data.  The end result was an outstanding group at 300 yards with R19 and Sierra 140 grain Matchking bullets.  Furthermore, I worked up a load with the Accubonds and it wouldn't come close to the SMK's in \"My Ruger Precision Rifle\".  And now to \"Water off\" the rest of the bunch.  I've been hunting with Sierra Matchking bullets for years and never lost a whitetail to this day.  Would I shoot elk, or bear with one?  Probably not, but I have never lost a deer yet that I've shot with a SMK.  Matter of fact, killed 3 this year and all fell in their tracks.  So take this bit of advise, before you waste powder, primers, bullets, AND money, just see what your rifle is \"Capable of\" with SMK's.   \n",

      "6418   Quality palette! I have been looking for this color story in an affordable palette for a while. After reading the reviews & watching some YouTube videos & reviews on the Nudist palette I decided to get it during a BOGO sale & using the $3.50 coupon. It is definitely worth full price. The dark colors are so blendable, and pigmented. I created a beautiful eye look in less than 5 mins. It works better than a lot of my more expensive palettes. I did have to reach into my singles for a lid shade. The shimmers didn't have enough pop for the look I was going for, but good enough for every day looks. I would recommend this palette, for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

      "6559   Durable, Comfortable and They Look Nice. The rating should be a 4.5 or 4.75, but such subtleties are not allowed. This is my fourth pair of Invincibles in as many years and the first pair, except for some sun fading, is still very serviceable. The fit is comfortable, the length provides coverage without restriction and the built in brief provides just the right amount of support.    The side pockets are very handy for carrying a number of items, in my case, an iphone as I listen to podcasts when I walk.  The side pockets are the one feature that prevents me from giving these shorts the best score. On the older model shorts, the side pockets allow about an 1\" or 1.5\" of the phone to protrude above the pocket, so the phone was secure, but also easy to extract if the need arose. On the newer models, the pocket envelops the whole phone and the strength of the velcro plus having to \"fish\" for the phone makes it more difficult to extract.  This is, to be sure, a minor issue, and will not deter me from ordering another pair in the near future as these are my go to shorts anytime the temperature is above 45 degrees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "7587   Love the Blazer but Not the NEW PRICE I purchased this blazer on October 10, on SALE for 39.99 and with my promo coupon, paid 33.99 for it. It has no buttons but that can easily be fixed if you want to spend a few more bucks. It goes great with jeans. PROBLEM -- It troubles me when I decided to log in on the Sunday after Black Friday and go surfing the Clearance section to see what I can purchase and come across this exact same blazer being sold for $59.98. WHAT IS THAT? THAT IS PRICE GOUGING! I am so disappointed with Banana Republic right now and I truly do not want to hear a lame excuse about how it was some special deal, bc BLACK FRIDAY DEALS are suppose to be one of the best.

My sneakers were regular price 75$ but because you took 1 penny off and made them 74.99 I didn't qualify for shipping. I tried to call customer service and you were closed... not good at all... if I didn't need the sneakers as bad as I do I wouldn't purchase through you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
      "9252   Not 2.5\" heel. Only 1.25\" I returned them because it says  \"1 1/2 inch heel height, 2 1/2 total heel height with wedge fit\"  . The heel is 1.25\" PERIOD. It is not 2.5\" and there is no wedge fit. I bought them because I wanted a 2.5\" heel. The description is wrong and I am waiting for my refund. Disappointed they do not have the description correct.

I emailed multiple times but no one ever answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "9532   Shipping $4 on an $8 mag? How do you charge at least $4 shipping per mag on an $8 mag? I was going to order 4 just to try out but $16.95 on $32 worth of magazines that weigh less than a pound total is highway robbery. Keep them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "9878   Very unsatisfied service I had two items that missed the delivery date and was assured I would receive 150 dollars plus 10 percent off the purchase.  My purchase order invoice was over 3000.00.  Because no other information was given I anticipated an approximate amount of 450.00.  I got told at the end of delivery under half that amount and then was hung up on.  I have not received any compensation and it has been 6 days.

      "11011  What a rip-off I bought this for a gift.  It was WAY too small (same size I had bought in other styles).  I paid EXTRA $$ to have it arrive on time for a birthday gift (2-day shipping) and it arrived 7 days afterwards.  When I exchanged it to get the proper size and have it shipped directly to my sister, they treated it as a return and deducted $5.00 from the purchase price plus all the extra shipping I paid.  In the end I was out $15.  I will never purchase another item from this vendor.

      "11522  I would buy this product again for this low price . I love Oakley sunglasses, and haven't owned any in about 30 years cause they are so expensive.When Midway USA had this special for $54.00 I jumped on it and bought me and my wife a pair. My wife had never owned a pair of Oakley's , and would never pay even $54.00 for a pair , so I surprised her with them and she loves them .Thanks Larry Potterfield for the sale price ,  Mick & Karen Hartgrove                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "11614  Yes I was forced to buy this cutter after purchasing Midsouth's once fired 6.5mm Creedmoor brass.  All the brass was longer than the overall case length size of 1.920\".  That said I have used the 3 in 1 for 22 caliber, 6mm, and 30 caliber cases.  It is an outstanding product.  With trimming and chamfering both the outside and the inside of the case at the same time it saves much effort and time in case preparation.  Of course a Forster case trimmer is required.  I have a Forster attachment to the trimmer that allows me to use my hand drill to automate the process and save my hand.  For trimming many lengthened cases I would not be without it.  I also pick up range brass in 5.56 and the cases most always exceed the maximum case length.  Processing hundreds of cases is an easy chore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "11644  Absolutely WORTH it!! I kind of balked a little at the price at first. I mean who spends 140.00 on a pillow even an organic one??  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this pillow and it is absolutely the best one I have ever owned. I hope it isn't like most pillows and.

      "14067  I would buy again but only in one color-not both Very sharp boot- ordered both black and brown when they were on sale for $80.  But still not sure I received such a great deal, and would prefer if they were a bit taller, and hit mid knee which is a more flattering height.  With all that said, they are extremely comfortable with a nice rubber sole that adds to that comfort.  The heel shape is great too-larger which adds to walking stability and creates a more casual look. I'll wear these for many years to come.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because I prefer if they were longer which is a more flattering look, and I would have preferred paying a lower price than the 79.95 final sale from Dillards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

I didn't expect to have to assemble a 600.00 sideboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
      "15520  Do not get this sectional!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We bought this sectional sofa four months ago. We also purchased the ottoman and the recliner with it and it is awful quality! It has ripped in several places. Not just the sofa but the ottoman and the recliner. Terrible product! It shouldn't even be sold! We spent $1200.00 on everything and if you make a purchase that big and especially it being furniture for your living room it should not tear up in four months! I wish I had my money back and I could get something else that is better quality! Very dissatisfied! DO NOT GET THIS!!! I had also ordered everything and when I got to the store they had sold my recliner to someone else so we ended up having to get the one on the floor which was the last one they had! My opinion we should be able to take it back and show them how bad it has torn apart and they should refund our money or let us pick anything else out that we want! I'm not even going to mention how many times we had to return to the store after we got home and parts were missing and the first one we bought we came home set everything up only to find that there was a RIP in the one we brought home from the store so we went back and they gave us a new one and four months later it's tearing up everywhere!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "16455  Not working less than 6 months time Using daily at least.  Had it since about Jan of this year.  I purchased at Dollar General in Bellville, TX.  It didn't work this morning at all, so I assumed I used up the batteries.  Changed same noting the correct position, and still does not come on, make a noise, nothing.  I am so angry.  Yes I only paid $7.50 but I could have bought a lot more batteries for that amount.  I really think I should at least be able to send in and get a new one, in exchange.  This is another typical reason why we should start paying attention to all the Chinese products.  And Dollar General would not exist if it had to use products made in USA or other acceptable countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "16749  A Bit Biased One star so it stands out.. please read! \\nSo Samsung wasn't my first choice nor was Brandsmart. Samsung because of their reputation in recent years and Brandsmart because of their extended warranty issues in the past and their vendors.. let's see fingers crossed. \\nHowever, Brandsmart had THE BEST price in town. Brandsmarts' deal was sooo good I couldn't pass the Samsung's. I really got a great deal. Paid $1199.99 for the set. PLUS warranty and a couple of other things (hoses, etc).\\nPros: They're spectacular thus far. This model is loaded with features. FYI the washer DOES have a drum light but only on the 5.0 cu ft not the 4.5 cu ft. Only had these units a couple of weeks so we'll see if they stand the test of time. \\nCons: 1) YOU HAVE TO BUY the WiFi Samsung - Universal Smart Home Adapter\\nModel:HD2018GH ($25 each) to enjoy the alert features and so on. You can ONLY control the units if you press a specific button on the machine each time which defeats the purpose since you're already there to press it yourself. You CAN however monitor the units regardless without pressing any buttons..which I have to say saves time because you exactly when your load is done..\\n2) Setting up the WiFi was a major pain in the BUTT! I'm lucky that I do IT and was able to figure it out. Basically, you separate your 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.. so no band-steering on your router if you want these to work. They ONLY connect to 2.4 GHz.. make sure your network has different names on those frequencies so you're able to connect them. \\n\\nNote: If the washer makes a lot of noise on the spin cycle try adjusting the little rubber legs. Height, etc. It was really loud here and I was able to adjust reducing the noise almost to nothing. \\n\\nI must say Brandsmart lowered their price on this set and getting the credit adjusted was a breeze. I'm very happy with them so far and this entire process.                                                                                                   \n",
      "16841  great grouping round for Kimber 84L I have 2 Kimber 84L rifles and this shoots cloverleaf groups out of both of them, easily 3/4\" groups out of several different boxes.  Plus, keep your brass because if you decide to load later it'll save you $1.50/shot for Nosler brass (yes, I know its not the exact same but Nosler customer support says its close).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "17625  The best  mid-sized range bag, would buy again. Very well made range bag. Everything about it is well made and heavy -duty. Just the right size for 3 or 4 handguns, plus everything else you need for a day of fun & games. The zippers are the best , handles and shoulder strap are comfortable and sturdy. This bag is built to last, well designed, and easy to carry. I paid $25.00 less for this bag @ ZORO than it was priced at the local gun store.

      "17852  Runs too Small I'm a bit disappointed in my first time trying NB shoes ever. I found this shoe looking fit latest best shoes for overpronation. Loved this color so I went with it. My toes were scrunched right up in the front of the shoe. I don't have an abnormally long toe or anything like that. I usually wear size 10, but this shoe is more like 9.75. I'm unsure if going a half size up would keep my same foot alignment/support where I need for overpronation.  The toe region also oddly seems to be missing support? Feels like there's no material between my toes and the ground, maybe some people like that, I don't.

      "18566  I would only buy it again when on sale! The Stamina Cutbacks that I recently purchased are only going to be used for casual wear.  Previous Stamina Cutbacks that I have purchased at retail stores where comfortable and I need a sneaker that is a wide fit.  However, it seems that the insoles do not have sufficient arch support so that I need to purchase a orthopedic grade insole that gives such support which adds another $50.00 to be able to wear the sneaker in complete comfort.  Also, if used for jogging the sneaker's tread wears out too fast in the heal area while the rest of the Stamina Cutback sneaker is still like new.   I put duck tape on the heel when it starts to wear down the black tread flat and starts to show the underneath white portion to get a little more life out of the sneaker since the rest is still like new.  I like the style and fit but they do not last long for running or jogging and need more arch support even though they are categorized as an athletic sneaker.  I only purchase them when on sale as I need to also purchase a better insole and the tread does not last long when used for jogging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "18694  Undisclosed Previous year I had purchased a full set of tires that cost over $750.00 &#40;GoodYear&#41;, I had nothing but flat ties and each time I had to get it patch. After complaining of tires purchased and salesperson said I needed new tires, I then informed him I had just purchased them last year and according to what he life of tires was 65k miles and I only had 25k miles. Sales representative told me that tires I purchased were defective and that he would give me credit for new ones. So, I proceeded to get new set of different brands of tires, giving the benefit of the doubt it was a defect.  This visit I went in for a flat tire, salesperson stated that my tires need to be replaced because they were at 4/32. Salesperson check miles when new tires were purchase back January 2019 and the life of tires purchased were 65k miles and compared to what miles I had was only 23k miles. How is this company/ tire name promising x miles and life of tires and they are not living up to it? He said they would give me credit to purchase new tire.

      "18952  I would NEVER buy these again! We are VERY dissatisfied with the new cushions.  We will never buy them again.  They were more expensive 50.00 each thinking they would be better.  They sink when you sit on them.

      "21216  For a woman who lips were dry as a desert When I turned 35 years old, my lips started to get very dry. I was getting desperate because the cracks I had were painful, my lip skin was falling apart, UGH! Horrible! It made me feel down and sad. My lips  looked so horrible like if they were part of a horror movie. I used everything! From cheap lip moisturizers to expensive ones (over $ 20.00). Then when getting my favorite toner from Mamonde, I saw they had this in the Grab and Go at my local Ulta Store. I love Mamonde and so I gave it a try... and O.M.G.!!!\\n\\nIt was amazing!!! At first I felt my lips a bit tingled but in less than three days my lips looked healthy, smooth and hydrated!!! I use this lip balm from morning to night. \\n\\nWhen I start my morning skin care routine I apply the balm at the end step of my hydration process (before applying makeup/lipstick), after I remove my makeup/cleansing skin care routine and before going to bed. It last a lot, the glossy effect is something I love too, you can put any lippie on top of it, or use any lipstick to give it a tint. Or just go with the natural gloss of it.\\n\\nI have used it for over 4 weeks and still have good amount of product. The price is right for the results I got, and will continue to use it. Thank you Mamonde for this wonderful lip balm!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "23246  Its thin. Its so thin its drapery. Not insulated at all. You want $54.99 full price, then $24.99 for discount then when I purchased it, it was on clearance for $15.94 & thank god for that bc its not worth more than $10 its so cheap feeling, thin and really isnt anything more than fashion wear since its NOT insulated. Walmart and Target have cheaper priced and better quality brands! Everyone save urself the trouble and money. The only mildly okay thing with this vest is its true to size, maybe with a little wiggle room as its considered 'outdoor wear'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
      "23257  Soft & cozy My daughter really liked that socks go up on the calf & stay up. Most \"slipper-type\" socks slide down & get bunched. Tho calf elastic could be a little tight for some girls over age 13 or 125 lbs.  I bought 8 pair of the socks in Christmas designs as small gift for nieces.

      "24167  What you expect I received a full size jar of Renergie Lift Multi-action Ultra Face Cream With SPF 30 to try for my honest review. I tried the cream for 2 weeks, applying in the morning and before bed. It really left my skin feeling silky smooth. I did not see much difference in tightening on my face, but did see an improvment on my neck...after losing 20lbs the skin was lose and looked tired. This really helped in that area. I liked the smell as well. The only down side is the price. If this was 50.00 or less I would buy it on a regular basis....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "25242  If I could, would buy one in every color,! I have dress coats for church and community events, but I needed something for casual and sporty that was really warm for northern Michigan.  Wore it yesterday when the temperature downstate dropped from 48 to 22 degrees. I was snug as a bug...a very warm bug.  Runs a bit large, but good for sweaters underneath.  Love the tie belt and adjustable cuffs.  Similar jackets here are well over $100.00.

PS GOOD quality...too bad they don't fit and they cost too much to return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "26322  Loved the price until I removed the plastic wrap I thought this was an awesome deal for $2.99 and had bought myself a a total of 5 of these frames in different colors.  I was going to buy one as a gift for a friend.  But when I removed the plastic wrap, I saw small indent or bubble imperfections in a couple of them.  I did not or could not see those imperfections through the plastic wrap or I would not have purchased them.  Luckily, of the ones I kept and am using, they sit on a shelf where people cannot get too close and hopefully will never notice the glass imperfections.  But I would have been embarrassed if one I gave as a gift had the same imperfection.  Overall, still a decent frame for a situation like mine and for the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
      "26422  It isn't worth the money! Before even getting this paid off, it is unraveling!! Very cheap materials and very cheaply made. I purchased it for my room,  the smaller rugs are used in the hall and the kitchen. I'm not sure about removing stains but as it is falling apart now, it will be trashed soon enough.Wearing high heels, playing games on it or having a pet in the home... forget these rugs! $134.00 total and 2 months old? What a waste of money 😭😭😭... Also, since it is made of cheap plastic polyester type material, DO NOT USE around open flames!

      "26876  Weekly Appointment Book Reorder #70-008, dimensions 3\"x6.25\".  For decades I have used this pocket calendar, with a black leather cover, address book insert and blank pad insert.  The store from which I bought inserts yearly lost its lease.  Office Depot has no refills and I cannot find anyone who sells them.  I should not have to buy a whole new product every year;  I just the insert(s)!

      "27522  Very nice saw, starts easy saws fast. One small problem We had a derecho (A line of intense, widespread, and fast-moving windstorms and sometimes thunderstorms that moves across a great distance and is characterized by damaging winds.) in eastern Iowa on 08/10/2020. Chain saws were hard to find. I found this at Ace Hardware. They had one left and delivered it to my truck curbside. Great people to do business with. We used it quite a bit at first but had to get a saw with 26\" bar. Unfortunately the chain adjuster on 16\" Craftsman is not like the older saws. It is a slotted head shaft with a gear at the end. That gear turns a geared head on what I would call the screw that turns the boss that tightens the bar. It would eventually strip both gears enough that you could not tighten the chain and bar. This \"Rube Goldberg\" design makes tightening the chain a chore. Instead of a straight screw and a boss to tighten the chain we have a 90 degree gear and pinion that get worn and sloppy. Said gear and pinion tightener is not sold separately. You have to replace the entire clutch assembly. I ordered one on 12/21/2020 from MTD Parts as MTD makes the saw for Craftsman $254.07 shipped to my door but the part is back ordered until the last week in January! Who thought and engineered  this foolish chain adjuster? Probably the same team who came up with \"New Coke Coca Cola.\" Now I gotta go refill my wind bag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "28487  Great for the price and cute print I got these on sale, so this review is based on paying $1.25 per mask. These are triple layer, which is what the CDC is recommended for cloth face masks now (December 2020), so that's nice. The fabric options are also great, and the adjustable ear loops are handy. I will say these are HUGE. They cover above the nose basically down to the neck, which is good for coverage, but kind of annoying on my face. I bought the kid size, too, and they still cover my nose and mouth just fine, so a size in between would be great. I have not washed yet, though, and other reviews say they shrink. I typically handwash masks, though. The addition of a metal nose piece would help immensely, but again, these were super cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "29274  Received incorrect items, no recourse from Shutterfly to cor I paid extra to purchase preaddressed envelopes to go with our Christmas cards this year. I received 60 envelopes that were preaddressed with someone else's name and address. When I contacted customer service I was informed that they would not replace the envelopes with corrected ones. The only recourse I was offered was a promo code for the purchase of preaddressed envelopes. You cannot purchase envelopes on their own through Shutterfly. They are only available as an add on to a card purchase. In addition, my promo code expires within the month so I can't even apply towards a future card purchase. So I paid roughly $100 for custom printed cards and envelopes that arrived incorrect and then I was informed that my only option was to buy a new set of cards with new envelopes and Shutterfly would cover the $17.40 cost for addressing those new envelopes, but not the $81 for the cards (which in reality would have been far higher because I used a now expired coupon code for 40% off). I will no longer be a Shutterfly customer after this experience. I have used this service for over 10 years for everything from Christmas cards to my wedding albums. My customer service experience this holiday season left me disappointed, angry, and having to scramble to find envelopes that matched in size and color somewhere else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "29947  Purchased 11/19, on sale for $11.17 less now... So I purchased a few items on 11/19, and now these jeans are $11.17 less than the price I paid. I chatted with someone at Duluth and was told since more than 7 days has passed and I already received them at a sales price back on 11/19, there was nothing they could do. Is it just me, or should they honor the lowered price three weeks later? I am now about to jump into my truck and return not just the unworn pair of jeans, but the unworn jacket I purchased on 11/19, and go shopping for another brand and product.

      "31177  I would not buy any product from Singer ever again. I ordered a Singer Patchwork Sewing and QUILTING Machine, you sent a regular Sewing Machine. Your ad has both items listed by side. You emailed the order confirmation at once. It took 3 days  and 2 emails from me to obtain delivery date and tracking number. The product arrived, but you sent the wrong item. I requested a shipping label from you, after 2 more requests without a word from you , I decided to return the product back to you and paid out of pocket $30.70 to ship it back to you. The shipping label arrived too late! I got multiple excuses from you and always suggesting that the fault was on my behalf. Please refer to emails to confirm my statements. I have been reimbursed $199.99 , but the $30.70 is still unpaid. I believe that singer should pay this amount to me immediately. My experience dealing with Singer has been overwhelmingly painful and expensive, yes, $30.70 worth.  My pride and purse attest witness to that. In case you decide to pay me back my address is Myra Fresquez PO Box 1801 Guymon Oklahoma 73942                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "951    Good rifle / poor magazine fit - Problem Solved! I thoroughly enjoy the weight and pointability of this 16\" barreled Ruger in 300 BLK. However, not only was the action very rough from the onset, but one could not cycle the action over an empty magazine due to the mag keeper physically blocking the bolt! (Note - I love P-mags in my AR platforms, but the Ruger factory issued 5.56 cal P-mag delivered with this .300 BLK Ruger rifle was the cause of the \"rough action!) ... I purchased and installed an after-market, METAL, 10 round, 300 BLK  (7.62x 39)  \"ASC brand\" magazine and this solved both problems. The bolt cycled noticeably smoother with the ASC magazine, plus i could now easily close the bolt over an empty mag. The difference this magazine swap made with the rifle's functionality is amazing. This was an inexpensive fix and saved me from selling my newly acquired Ruger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "1804   Does what it says! I have been through numerous flat irons (from $29.00 up to $300 brands) and they all ended up making my hair smell burned.  Since I have very thick, wavy hair I have to put it on the highest settings.  Still, I have to pass it through so many times that my wrist ends up cramping way before I'm done!  This one works on the first pass and with no burning smell.

      "3590   LIFE CHANGER (for your eyes, anyway!) I received a 0.17 oz tube from a friend about 7 months ago and I'll get easily another month out of it! I'm here to reorder (cannot bear the idea of running out!) the full size, and one for a friend.\\nI have tried dozens of shadow primers, and until I used this product, I had no idea what a primer COULD and SHOULD do. It's a thicker formula than I've ever tried - I \"pat\" in on gently before smoothing it out. Women have asked me how I keep my eyeshadow perfect all day, no matter if I'm sweating, at work, or up all night....and I'm more than happy to tell! I have actually gone THREE days/2 (sleeping) nights (don't ask), and while the rest of my makeup looked worn out, my eyes looked GREAT!\\n\\nI'll be sure to add photos later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

What a scam, there was a reason why I stayed away from Pampered Chef for so long!!!!!!!!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "4669   DISAPPOINTED with Lucky Brand I'd been waiting for this jacket to go on sale & ordered a medium on 11/15 when it went on sale for $71.40. Received an email on 11/17 that the order was fulfilled & had shipped but I NEVER RECEIVED, I was refunded though. When I checked online it showed there were 5 small left in stock, so I called Lucky Brand to order in that size but was told even though the website reflected that, it was actually out of stock. Not the first time this has happened to me from this company, apparently inventory control & customer service isn't of importance anymore!

      "5445   Absolutely would buy again Ok, so let me go ahead and say I'm going to \"water off\" people out there (i.e. hunters and competition shooters). I have been handloading my ammo for 39 years.  Started in in 1980.  Didn't know much then, I had a Lee Loader in .44 magnum, .45-70, and .30-30.  You guys that get free coffee at Hardees know what a Lee Loader is.  Back then I used to load Sierra Matchkings for my Remington model 788 in .30-30, not because they shot good (which they did) but because I like the way they looked.  Since that time I have owned hundreds of rifles in a lot of calibers and I always go back to Sierra Matchking bullets \"IF\" I want to know what a rifle is capable of.  I just had take a refresher course on that.  I purchased 2 boxes of 142 grain Accubonds, and a box of 143 grain ELD-X bullets, working up a load for my 6.5 Creedmoor.  I was disappointed to see that my RCBS dies slightly damaged the Accubonds and Eld-X bullets.  To my dismay, I spent $192.00 on Redding Competition dies and a VLD bullet seater.  Needless to say, I was not completely satisfied with the accuracy results.  In an act of desperation, I grabbed a box of 140 grain Sierra Matchking bullets, a pound of R19 powder, as H4350 is no where to be found, and began working up a load following online Sierra load data.  The end result was an outstanding group at 300 yards with R19 and Sierra 140 grain Matchking bullets.  Furthermore, I worked up a load with the Accubonds and it wouldn't come close to the SMK's in \"My Ruger Precision Rifle\".  And now to \"Water off\" the rest of the bunch.  I've been hunting with Sierra Matchking bullets for years and never lost a whitetail to this day.  Would I shoot elk, or bear with one?  Probably not, but I have never lost a deer yet that I've shot with a SMK.  Matter of fact, killed 3 this year and all fell in their tracks.  So take this bit of advise, before you waste powder, primers, bullets, AND money, just see what your rifle is \"Capable of\" with SMK's.   \n",

      "6418   Quality palette! I have been looking for this color story in an affordable palette for a while. After reading the reviews & watching some YouTube videos & reviews on the Nudist palette I decided to get it during a BOGO sale & using the . It is definitely worth full price. The dark colors are so blendable, and pigmented. I created a beautiful eye look in less than 5 mins. It works better than a lot of my more expensive palettes. I did have to reach into my singles for a lid shade. The shimmers didn't have enough pop for the look I was going for, but good enough for every day looks. I would recommend this palette, for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "6559   Durable, Comfortable and They Look Nice. The rating should be a 4.5 or 4.75, but such subtleties are not allowed. This is my fourth pair of Invincibles in as many years and the first pair, except for some sun fading, is still very serviceable. The fit is comfortable, the length provides coverage without restriction and the built in brief provides just the right amount of support.    The side pockets are very handy for carrying a number of items, in my case, an iphone as I listen to podcasts when I walk.  The side pockets are the one feature that prevents me from giving these shorts the best score. On the older model shorts, the side pockets allow about an 1\" or 1.5\" of the phone to protrude above the pocket, so the phone was secure, but also easy to extract if the need arose. On the newer models, the pocket envelops the whole phone and the strength of the velcro plus having to \"fish\" for the phone makes it more difficult to extract.  This is, to be sure, a minor issue, and will not deter me from ordering another pair in the near future as these are my go to shorts anytime the temperature is above 45 degrees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "7587   Love the Blazer but Not the NEW PRICE I purchased this blazer on October 10, on SALE for 39.99 and with my promo coupon, paid 33.99 for it. It has no buttons but that can easily be fixed if you want to spend a few more bucks. It goes great with jeans. PROBLEM -- It troubles me when I decided to log in on the Sunday after Black Friday and go surfing the Clearance section to see what I can purchase and come across this exact same blazer being sold for $59.98. WHAT IS THAT? THAT IS PRICE GOUGING! I am so disappointed with Banana Republic right now and I truly do not want to hear a lame excuse about how it was some special deal, bc BLACK FRIDAY DEALS are suppose to be one of the best.

My sneakers were regular price 75$ but because you took 1 penny off and made them 74.99 I didn't qualify for shipping. I tried to call customer service and you were closed... not good at all... if I didn't need the sneakers as bad as I do I wouldn't purchase through you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
      "9252   Not 2.5\" heel. Only 1.25\" I returned them because it says  \"1 1/2 inch heel height, 2 1/2 total heel height with wedge fit\"  . The heel is 1.25\" PERIOD. It is not 2.5\" and there is no wedge fit. I bought them because I wanted a 2.5\" heel. The description is wrong and I am waiting for my refund. Disappointed they do not have the description correct.

I emailed multiple times but no one ever answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "9532   Shipping $4 on an $8 mag? How do you charge at least $4 shipping per mag on an $8 mag? I was going to order 4 just to try out but $16.95 on $32 worth of magazines that weigh less than a pound total is highway robbery. Keep them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "9878   Very unsatisfied service I had two items that missed the delivery date and was assured I would receive 150 dollars plus 10 percent off the purchase.  My purchase order invoice was over 3000.00.  Because no other information was given I anticipated an approximate amount of 450.00.  I got told at the end of delivery under half that amount and then was hung up on.  I have not received any compensation and it has been 6 days.

      "11011  What a rip-off I bought this for a gift.  It was WAY too small (same size I had bought in other styles).  I paid EXTRA $$ to have it arrive on time for a birthday gift (2-day shipping) and it arrived 7 days afterwards.  When I exchanged it to get the proper size and have it shipped directly to my sister, they treated it as a return and deducted $5.00 from the purchase price plus all the extra shipping I paid.  In the end I was out $15.  I will never purchase another item from this vendor.

      "11522  I would buy this product again for this low price . I love Oakley sunglasses, and haven't owned any in about 30 years cause they are so expensive.When Midway USA had this special for $54.00 I jumped on it and bought me and my wife a pair. My wife had never owned a pair of Oakley's , and would never pay even $54.00 for a pair , so I surprised her with them and she loves them .Thanks Larry Potterfield for the sale price ,  Mick & Karen Hartgrove                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "11614  Yes I was forced to buy this cutter after purchasing Midsouth's once fired 6.5mm Creedmoor brass.  All the brass was longer than the overall case length size of 1.920\".  That said I have used the 3 in 1 for 22 caliber, 6mm, and 30 caliber cases.  It is an outstanding product.  With trimming and chamfering both the outside and the inside of the case at the same time it saves much effort and time in case preparation.  Of course a Forster case trimmer is required.  I have a Forster attachment to the trimmer that allows me to use my hand drill to automate the process and save my hand.  For trimming many lengthened cases I would not be without it.  I also pick up range brass in 5.56 and the cases most always exceed the maximum case length.  Processing hundreds of cases is an easy chore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "11644  Absolutely WORTH it!! I kind of balked a little at the price at first. I mean who spends 140.00 on a pillow even an organic one??  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this pillow and it is absolutely the best one I have ever owned. I hope it isn't like most pillows and.

      "14067  I would buy again but only in one color-not both Very sharp boot- ordered both black and brown when they were on sale for $80.  But still not sure I received such a great deal, and would prefer if they were a bit taller, and hit mid knee which is a more flattering height.  With all that said, they are extremely comfortable with a nice rubber sole that adds to that comfort.  The heel shape is great too-larger which adds to walking stability and creates a more casual look. I'll wear these for many years to come.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because I prefer if they were longer which is a more flattering look, and I would have preferred paying a lower price than the 79.95 final sale from Dillards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

I didn't expect to have to assemble a 600.00 sideboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
      "15520  Do not get this sectional!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We bought this sectional sofa four months ago. We also purchased the ottoman and the recliner with it and it is awful quality! It has ripped in several places. Not just the sofa but the ottoman and the recliner. Terrible product! It shouldn't even be sold! We spent $1200.00 on everything and if you make a purchase that big and especially it being furniture for your living room it should not tear up in four months! I wish I had my money back and I could get something else that is better quality! Very dissatisfied! DO NOT GET THIS!!! I had also ordered everything and when I got to the store they had sold my recliner to someone else so we ended up having to get the one on the floor which was the last one they had! My opinion we should be able to take it back and show them how bad it has torn apart and they should refund our money or let us pick anything else out that we want! I'm not even going to mention how many times we had to return to the store after we got home and parts were missing and the first one we bought we came home set everything up only to find that there was a RIP in the one we brought home from the store so we went back and they gave us a new one and four months later it's tearing up everywhere!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "16455  Not working less than 6 months time Using daily at least.  Had it since about Jan of this year.  I purchased at Dollar General in Bellville, TX.  It didn't work this morning at all, so I assumed I used up the batteries.  Changed same noting the correct position, and still does not come on, make a noise, nothing.  I am so angry.  Yes I only paid $7.50 but I could have bought a lot more batteries for that amount.  I really think I should at least be able to send in and get a new one, in exchange.  This is another typical reason why we should start paying attention to all the Chinese products.  And Dollar General would not exist if it had to use products made in USA or other acceptable countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "16749  A Bit Biased One star so it stands out.. please read! \\nSo Samsung wasn't my first choice nor was Brandsmart. Samsung because of their reputation in recent years and Brandsmart because of their extended warranty issues in the past and their vendors.. let's see fingers crossed. \\nHowever, Brandsmart had THE BEST price in town. Brandsmarts' deal was sooo good I couldn't pass the Samsung's. I really got a great deal. Paid $1199.99 for the set. PLUS warranty and a couple of other things (hoses, etc).\\nPros: They're spectacular thus far. This model is loaded with features. FYI the washer DOES have a drum light but only on the 5.0 cu ft not the 4.5 cu ft. Only had these units a couple of weeks so we'll see if they stand the test of time. \\nCons: 1) YOU HAVE TO BUY the WiFi Samsung - Universal Smart Home Adapter\\nModel:HD2018GH ($25 each) to enjoy the alert features and so on. You can ONLY control the units if you press a specific button on the machine each time which defeats the purpose since you're already there to press it yourself. You CAN however monitor the units regardless without pressing any buttons..which I have to say saves time because you exactly when your load is done..\\n2) Setting up the WiFi was a major pain in the BUTT! I'm lucky that I do IT and was able to figure it out. Basically, you separate your 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.. so no band-steering on your router if you want these to work. They ONLY connect to 2.4 GHz.. make sure your network has different names on those frequencies so you're able to connect them. \\n\\nNote: If the washer makes a lot of noise on the spin cycle try adjusting the little rubber legs. Height, etc. It was really loud here and I was able to adjust reducing the noise almost to nothing. \\n\\nI must say Brandsmart lowered their price on this set and getting the credit adjusted was a breeze. I'm very happy with them so far and this entire process.                                                                                                   \n",
      "16841  great grouping round for Kimber 84L I have 2 Kimber 84L rifles and this shoots cloverleaf groups out of both of them, easily 3/4\" groups out of several different boxes.  Plus, keep your brass because if you decide to load later it'll save you $1.50/shot for Nosler brass (yes, I know its not the exact same but Nosler customer support says its close).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "17625  The best  mid-sized range bag, would buy again. Very well made range bag. Everything about it is well made and heavy -duty. Just the right size for 3 or 4 handguns, plus everything else you need for a day of fun & games. The zippers are the best , handles and shoulder strap are comfortable and sturdy. This bag is built to last, well designed, and easy to carry. I paid  for this bag @ ZORO than it was priced at the local gun store.

      "17852  Runs too Small I'm a bit disappointed in my first time trying NB shoes ever. I found this shoe looking fit latest best shoes for overpronation. Loved this color so I went with it. My toes were scrunched right up in the front of the shoe. I don't have an abnormally long toe or anything like that. I usually wear size 10, but this shoe is more like 9.75. I'm unsure if going a half size up would keep my same foot alignment/support where I need for overpronation.  The toe region also oddly seems to be missing support? Feels like there's no material between my toes and the ground, maybe some people like that, I don't.

      "18566  I would only buy it again when on sale! The Stamina Cutbacks that I recently purchased are only going to be used for casual wear.  Previous Stamina Cutbacks that I have purchased at retail stores where comfortable and I need a sneaker that is a wide fit.  However, it seems that the insoles do not have sufficient arch support so that I need to purchase a orthopedic grade insole that gives such support which adds another $50.00 to be able to wear the sneaker in complete comfort.  Also, if used for jogging the sneaker's tread wears out too fast in the heal area while the rest of the Stamina Cutback sneaker is still like new.   I put duck tape on the heel when it starts to wear down the black tread flat and starts to show the underneath white portion to get a little more life out of the sneaker since the rest is still like new.  I like the style and fit but they do not last long for running or jogging and need more arch support even though they are categorized as an athletic sneaker.  I only purchase them when on sale as I need to also purchase a better insole and the tread does not last long when used for jogging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "18694  Undisclosed Previous year I had purchased a full set of tires that cost  &#40;GoodYear&#41;, I had nothing but flat ties and each time I had to get it patch. After complaining of tires purchased and salesperson said I needed new tires, I then informed him I had just purchased them last year and according to what he life of tires was 65k miles and I only had 25k miles. Sales representative told me that tires I purchased were defective and that he would give me credit for new ones. So, I proceeded to get new set of different brands of tires, giving the benefit of the doubt it was a defect.  This visit I went in for a flat tire, salesperson stated that my tires need to be replaced because they were at 4/32. Salesperson check miles when new tires were purchase back January 2019 and the life of tires purchased were 65k miles and compared to what miles I had was only 23k miles. How is this company/ tire name promising x miles and life of tires and they are not living up to it? He said they would give me credit to purchase new tire.

      "18952  I would NEVER buy these again! We are VERY dissatisfied with the new cushions.  We will never buy them again.  They were more expensive 50.00 each thinking they would be better.  They sink when you sit on them.

      "21216  For a woman who lips were dry as a desert When I turned 35 years old, my lips started to get very dry. I was getting desperate because the cracks I had were painful, my lip skin was falling apart, UGH! Horrible! It made me feel down and sad. My lips  looked so horrible like if they were part of a horror movie. I used everything! From cheap lip moisturizers to expensive ones (over $ 20.00). Then when getting my favorite toner from Mamonde, I saw they had this in the Grab and Go at my local Ulta Store. I love Mamonde and so I gave it a try... and O.M.G.!!!\\n\\nIt was amazing!!! At first I felt my lips a bit tingled but in less than three days my lips looked healthy, smooth and hydrated!!! I use this lip balm from morning to night. \\n\\nWhen I start my morning skin care routine I apply the balm at the end step of my hydration process (before applying makeup/lipstick), after I remove my makeup/cleansing skin care routine and before going to bed. It last a lot, the glossy effect is something I love too, you can put any lippie on top of it, or use any lipstick to give it a tint. Or just go with the natural gloss of it.\\n\\nI have used it for over 4 weeks and still have good amount of product. The price is right for the results I got, and will continue to use it. Thank you Mamonde for this wonderful lip balm!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "23246  Its thin. Its so thin its drapery. Not insulated at all. You want $54.99 full price, then $24.99 for discount then when I purchased it, it was on clearance for $15.94 & thank god for that bc its not worth  its so cheap feeling, thin and really isnt anything more than fashion wear since its NOT insulated. Walmart and Target have cheaper priced and better quality brands! Everyone save urself the trouble and money. The only mildly okay thing with this vest is its true to size, maybe with a little wiggle room as its considered 'outdoor wear'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "23257  Soft & cozy My daughter really liked that socks go up on the calf & stay up. Most \"slipper-type\" socks slide down & get bunched. Tho calf elastic could be a little tight for some girls over age 13 or 125 lbs.  I bought 8 pair of the socks in Christmas designs as small gift for nieces.

      "24167  What you expect I received a full size jar of Renergie Lift Multi-action Ultra Face Cream With SPF 30 to try for my honest review. I tried the cream for 2 weeks, applying in the morning and before bed. It really left my skin feeling silky smooth. I did not see much difference in tightening on my face, but did see an improvment on my neck...after losing 20lbs the skin was lose and looked tired. This really helped in that area. I liked the smell as well. The only down side is the price. If this was 50.00 or less I would buy it on a regular basis....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "25242  If I could, would buy one in every color,! I have dress coats for church and community events, but I needed something for casual and sporty that was really warm for northern Michigan.

PS GOOD quality...too bad they don't fit and they cost too much to return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "26322  Loved the price until I removed the plastic wrap I thought this was an awesome deal for $2.99 and had bought myself a a total of 5 of these frames in different colors.  I was going to buy one as a gift for a friend.  But when I removed the plastic wrap, I saw small indent or bubble imperfections in a couple of them.  I did not or could not see those imperfections through the plastic wrap or I would not have purchased them.  Luckily, of the ones I kept and am using, they sit on a shelf where people cannot get too close and hopefully will never notice the glass imperfections.  But I would have been embarrassed if one I gave as a gift had the same imperfection.  Overall, still a decent frame for a situation like mine and for the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
      "26422  It isn't worth the money! Before even getting this paid off, it is unraveling!! Very cheap materials and very cheaply made. I purchased it for my room,  the smaller rugs are used in the hall and the kitchen. I'm not sure about removing stains but as it is falling apart now, it will be trashed soon enough.Wearing high heels, playing games on it or having a pet in the home... forget these rugs! $134.00 total and 2 months old? What a waste of money 😭😭😭... Also, since it is made of cheap plastic polyester type material, DO NOT USE around open flames!

      "26876  Weekly Appointment Book Reorder #70-008, dimensions 3\"x6.25\".  For decades I have used this pocket calendar, with a black leather cover, address book insert and blank pad insert.  The store from which I bought inserts yearly lost its lease.  Office Depot has no refills and I cannot find anyone who sells them.  I should not have to buy a whole new product every year;  I just the insert(s)!

      "27522  Very nice saw, starts easy saws fast. One small problem We had a derecho (A line of intense, widespread, and fast-moving windstorms and sometimes thunderstorms that moves across a great distance and is characterized by damaging winds.) in eastern Iowa on 08/10/2020. Chain saws were hard to find. I found this at Ace Hardware. They had one left and delivered it to my truck curbside. Great people to do business with. We used it quite a bit at first but had to get a saw with 26\" bar. Unfortunately the chain adjuster on 16\" Craftsman is not like the older saws. It is a slotted head shaft with a gear at the end. That gear turns a geared head on what I would call the screw that turns the boss that tightens the bar. It would eventually strip both gears enough that you could not tighten the chain and bar. This \"Rube Goldberg\" design makes tightening the chain a chore. Instead of a straight screw and a boss to tighten the chain we have a 90 degree gear and pinion that get worn and sloppy. Said gear and pinion tightener is not sold separately. You have to replace the entire clutch assembly. I ordered one on 12/21/2020 from MTD Parts as MTD makes the saw for Craftsman $254.07 shipped to my door but the part is back ordered until the last week in January! Who thought and engineered  this foolish chain adjuster? Probably the same team who came up with \"New Coke Coca Cola.\" Now I gotta go refill my wind bag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "28487  Great for the price and cute print I got these on sale, so this review is based on paying $1.25 per mask. These are triple layer, which is what the CDC is recommended for cloth face masks now (December 2020), so that's nice. The fabric options are also great, and the adjustable ear loops are handy. I will say these are HUGE. They cover above the nose basically down to the neck, which is good for coverage, but kind of annoying on my face. I bought the kid size, too, and they still cover my nose and mouth just fine, so a size in between would be great. I have not washed yet, though, and other reviews say they shrink. I typically handwash masks, though. The addition of a metal nose piece would help immensely, but again, these were super cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "29274  Received incorrect items, no recourse from Shutterfly to cor I paid extra to purchase preaddressed envelopes to go with our Christmas cards this year. I received 60 envelopes that were preaddressed with someone else's name and address. When I contacted customer service I was informed that they would not replace the envelopes with corrected ones. The only recourse I was offered was a promo code for the purchase of preaddressed envelopes. You cannot purchase envelopes on their own through Shutterfly. They are only available as an add on to a card purchase. In addition, my promo code expires within the month so I can't even apply towards a future card purchase. So I paid roughly $100 for custom printed cards and envelopes that arrived incorrect and then I was informed that my only option was to buy a new set of cards with new envelopes and Shutterfly would cover the $17.40 cost for addressing those new envelopes, but not the $81 for the cards (which in reality would have been far higher because I used a now expired coupon code for 40% off). I will no longer be a Shutterfly customer after this experience. I have used this service for over 10 years for everything from Christmas cards to my wedding albums. My customer service experience this holiday season left me disappointed, angry, and having to scramble to find envelopes that matched in size and color somewhere else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "29947  Purchased 11/19, on sale for  now... So I purchased a few items on 11/19, and now these jeans are  than the price I paid. I chatted with someone at Duluth and was told since more than 7 days has passed and I already received them at a sales price back on 11/19, there was nothing they could do. Is it just me, or should they honor the lowered price three weeks later?

      "31177  I would not buy any product from Singer ever again. I ordered a Singer Patchwork Sewing and QUILTING Machine, you sent a regular Sewing Machine. Your ad has both items listed by side. You emailed the order confirmation at once. It took 3 days  and 2 emails from me to obtain delivery date and tracking number. The product arrived, but you sent the wrong item. I requested a shipping label from you, after 2 more requests without a word from you , I decided to return the product back to you and paid out of pocket $30.70 to ship it back to you. The shipping label arrived too late! I got multiple excuses from you and always suggesting that the fault was on my behalf. Please refer to emails to confirm my statements. I have been reimbursed $199.99 , but the $30.70 is still unpaid. I believe that singer should pay this amount to me immediately. My experience dealing with Singer has been overwhelmingly painful and expensive, yes, $30.70 worth.  My pride and purse attest witness to that. In case you decide to pay me back my address is Myra Fresquez PO Box 1801 Guymon Oklahoma 73942                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "951    Good rifle / poor magazine fit - Problem Solved! I thoroughly enjoy the weight and pointability of this 16\" barreled Ruger in 300 BLK. However, not only was the action very rough from the onset, but one could not cycle the action over an empty magazine due to the mag keeper physically blocking the bolt! (Note - I love P-mags in my AR platforms, but the Ruger factory issued 5.56 cal P-mag delivered with this .300 BLK Ruger rifle was the cause of the \"rough action!) ... I purchased and installed an after-market, METAL, 10 round, 300 BLK  (7.62x 39)  \"ASC brand\" magazine and this solved both problems. The bolt cycled noticeably smoother with the ASC magazine, plus i could now easily close the bolt over an empty mag. The difference this magazine swap made with the rifle's functionality is amazing. This was an inexpensive fix and saved me from selling my newly acquired Ruger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "1804   Does what it says! I have been through numerous flat irons (from $29.00 up to $300 brands) and they all ended up making my hair smell burned.  Since I have very thick, wavy hair I have to put it on the highest settings.  Still, I have to pass it through so many times that my wrist ends up cramping way before I'm done!  This one works on the first pass and with no burning smell.

      "3590   LIFE CHANGER (for your eyes, anyway!) I received a 0.17 oz tube from a friend about 7 months ago and I'll get easily another month out of it! I'm here to reorder (cannot bear the idea of running out!) the full size, and one for a friend.\\nI have tried dozens of shadow primers, and until I used this product, I had no idea what a primer COULD and SHOULD do. It's a thicker formula than I've ever tried - I \"pat\" in on gently before smoothing it out. Women have asked me how I keep my eyeshadow perfect all day, no matter if I'm sweating, at work, or up all night....and I'm more than happy to tell! I have actually gone THREE days/2 (sleeping) nights (don't ask), and while the rest of my makeup looked worn out, my eyes looked GREAT!\\n\\nI'll be sure to add photos later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

What a scam, there was a reason why I stayed away from Pampered Chef for so long!!!!!!!!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "4669   DISAPPOINTED with Lucky Brand I'd been waiting for this jacket to go on sale & ordered a medium on 11/15 when it went on sale for $71.40. Received an email on 11/17 that the order was fulfilled & had shipped but I NEVER RECEIVED, I was refunded though. When I checked online it showed there were 5 small left in stock, so I called Lucky Brand to order in that size but was told even though the website reflected that, it was actually out of stock. Not the first time this has happened to me from this company, apparently inventory control & customer service isn't of importance anymore!

      "5445   Absolutely would buy again Ok, so let me go ahead and say I'm going to \"water off\" people out there (i.e. hunters and competition shooters). I have been handloading my ammo for 39 years.  Started in in 1980.  Didn't know much then, I had a Lee Loader in .44 magnum, .45-70, and .30-30.  You guys that get free coffee at Hardees know what a Lee Loader is.  Back then I used to load Sierra Matchkings for my Remington model 788 in .30-30, not because they shot good (which they did) but because I like the way they looked.  Since that time I have owned hundreds of rifles in a lot of calibers and I always go back to Sierra Matchking bullets \"IF\" I want to know what a rifle is capable of.  I just had take a refresher course on that.  I purchased 2 boxes of 142 grain Accubonds, and a box of 143 grain ELD-X bullets, working up a load for my 6.5 Creedmoor.  I was disappointed to see that my RCBS dies slightly damaged the Accubonds and Eld-X bullets.  To my dismay, I spent $192.00 on Redding Competition dies and a VLD bullet seater.  Needless to say, I was not completely satisfied with the accuracy results.  In an act of desperation, I grabbed a box of 140 grain Sierra Matchking bullets, a pound of R19 powder, as H4350 is no where to be found, and began working up a load following online Sierra load data.  The end result was an outstanding group at 300 yards with R19 and Sierra 140 grain Matchking bullets.  Furthermore, I worked up a load with the Accubonds and it wouldn't come close to the SMK's in \"My Ruger Precision Rifle\".  And now to \"Water off\" the rest of the bunch.  I've been hunting with Sierra Matchking bullets for years and never lost a whitetail to this day.  Would I shoot elk, or bear with one?  Probably not, but I have never lost a deer yet that I've shot with a SMK.  Matter of fact, killed 3 this year and all fell in their tracks.  So take this bit of advise, before you waste powder, primers, bullets, AND money, just see what your rifle is \"Capable of\" with SMK's.   \n",

      "6418   Quality palette! I have been looking for this color story in an affordable palette for a while. After reading the reviews & watching some YouTube videos & reviews on the Nudist palette I decided to get it during a BOGO sale & using the . It is definitely worth full price. The dark colors are so blendable, and pigmented. I created a beautiful eye look in less than 5 mins. It works better than a lot of my more expensive palettes. I did have to reach into my singles for a lid shade. The shimmers didn't have enough pop for the look I was going for, but good enough for every day looks. I would recommend this palette, for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "6559   Durable, Comfortable and They Look Nice. The rating should be a 4.5 or 4.75, but such subtleties are not allowed. This is my fourth pair of Invincibles in as many years and the first pair, except for some sun fading, is still very serviceable. The fit is comfortable, the length provides coverage without restriction and the built in brief provides just the right amount of support.    The side pockets are very handy for carrying a number of items, in my case, an iphone as I listen to podcasts when I walk.  The side pockets are the one feature that prevents me from giving these shorts the best score. On the older model shorts, the side pockets allow about an 1\" or 1.5\" of the phone to protrude above the pocket, so the phone was secure, but also easy to extract if the need arose. On the newer models, the pocket envelops the whole phone and the strength of the velcro plus having to \"fish\" for the phone makes it more difficult to extract.  This is, to be sure, a minor issue, and will not deter me from ordering another pair in the near future as these are my go to shorts anytime the temperature is above 45 degrees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "7587   Love the Blazer but Not the NEW PRICE I purchased this blazer on October 10, on SALE for 39.99 and with my promo coupon, paid 33.99 for it. It has no buttons but that can easily be fixed if you want to spend a few more bucks. It goes great with jeans. PROBLEM -- It troubles me when I decided to log in on the Sunday after Black Friday and go surfing the Clearance section to see what I can purchase and come across this exact same blazer being sold for $59.98. WHAT IS THAT? THAT IS PRICE GOUGING! I am so disappointed with Banana Republic right now and I truly do not want to hear a lame excuse about how it was some special deal, bc BLACK FRIDAY DEALS are suppose to be one of the best.

My sneakers were regular price 75$ but because you took 1 penny off and made them 74.99 I didn't qualify for shipping. I tried to call customer service and you were closed... not good at all... if I didn't need the sneakers as bad as I do I wouldn't purchase through you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
      "9252   Not 2.5\" heel. Only 1.25\" I returned them because it says  \"1 1/2 inch heel height, 2 1/2 total heel height with wedge fit\"  . The heel is 1.25\" PERIOD. It is not 2.5\" and there is no wedge fit. I bought them because I wanted a 2.5\" heel. The description is wrong and I am waiting for my refund. Disappointed they do not have the description correct.

I emailed multiple times but no one ever answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "9532   Shipping $4 on an $8 mag? How do you charge at least $4 shipping per mag on an $8 mag? I was going to order 4 just to try out but $16.95 on $32 worth of magazines that weigh less than a pound total is highway robbery. Keep them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "9878   Very unsatisfied service I had two items that missed the delivery date and was assured I would receive 150 dollars plus 10 percent off the purchase.  My purchase order invoice was over 3000.00.  Because no other information was given I anticipated an approximate amount of 450.00.  I got told at the end of delivery under half that amount and then was hung up on.  I have not received any compensation and it has been 6 days.

      "11011  What a rip-off I bought this for a gift.  It was WAY too small (same size I had bought in other styles).  I paid EXTRA $$ to have it arrive on time for a birthday gift (2-day shipping) and it arrived 7 days afterwards.  When I exchanged it to get the proper size and have it shipped directly to my sister, they treated it as a return and deducted $5.00 from the purchase price plus all the extra shipping I paid.  In the end I was out $15.  I will never purchase another item from this vendor.

      "11522  I would buy this product again for this low price . I love Oakley sunglasses, and haven't owned any in about 30 years cause they are so expensive.When Midway USA had this special for $54.00 I jumped on it and bought me and my wife a pair. My wife had never owned a pair of Oakley's , and would never pay even $54.00 for a pair , so I surprised her with them and she loves them .Thanks Larry Potterfield for the sale price ,  Mick & Karen Hartgrove                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "11614  Yes I was forced to buy this cutter after purchasing Midsouth's once fired 6.5mm Creedmoor brass.  All the brass was longer than the overall case length size of 1.920\".  That said I have used the 3 in 1 for 22 caliber, 6mm, and 30 caliber cases.  It is an outstanding product.  With trimming and chamfering both the outside and the inside of the case at the same time it saves much effort and time in case preparation.  Of course a Forster case trimmer is required.  I have a Forster attachment to the trimmer that allows me to use my hand drill to automate the process and save my hand.  For trimming many lengthened cases I would not be without it.  I also pick up range brass in 5.56 and the cases most always exceed the maximum case length.  Processing hundreds of cases is an easy chore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "11644  Absolutely WORTH it!! I kind of balked a little at the price at first. I mean who spends 140.00 on a pillow even an organic one??  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this pillow and it is absolutely the best one I have ever owned. I hope it isn't like most pillows and.

      "14067  I would buy again but only in one color-not both Very sharp boot- ordered both black and brown when they were on sale for $80.  But still not sure I received such a great deal, and would prefer if they were a bit taller, and hit mid knee which is a more flattering height.  With all that said, they are extremely comfortable with a nice rubber sole that adds to that comfort.  The heel shape is great too-larger which adds to walking stability and creates a more casual look. I'll wear these for many years to come.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because I prefer if they were longer which is a more flattering look, and I would have preferred paying a lower price than the 79.95 final sale from Dillards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

I didn't expect to have to assemble a 600.00 sideboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
      "15520  Do not get this sectional!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We bought this sectional sofa four months ago. We also purchased the ottoman and the recliner with it and it is awful quality! It has ripped in several places. Not just the sofa but the ottoman and the recliner. Terrible product! It shouldn't even be sold! We spent $1200.00 on everything and if you make a purchase that big and especially it being furniture for your living room it should not tear up in four months! I wish I had my money back and I could get something else that is better quality! Very dissatisfied! DO NOT GET THIS!!! I had also ordered everything and when I got to the store they had sold my recliner to someone else so we ended up having to get the one on the floor which was the last one they had! My opinion we should be able to take it back and show them how bad it has torn apart and they should refund our money or let us pick anything else out that we want! I'm not even going to mention how many times we had to return to the store after we got home and parts were missing and the first one we bought we came home set everything up only to find that there was a RIP in the one we brought home from the store so we went back and they gave us a new one and four months later it's tearing up everywhere!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "16455  Not working less than 6 months time Using daily at least.  Had it since about Jan of this year.  I purchased at Dollar General in Bellville, TX.  It didn't work this morning at all, so I assumed I used up the batteries.  Changed same noting the correct position, and still does not come on, make a noise, nothing.  I am so angry.  Yes I only paid $7.50 but I could have bought a lot more batteries for that amount.  I really think I should at least be able to send in and get a new one, in exchange.  This is another typical reason why we should start paying attention to all the Chinese products.  And Dollar General would not exist if it had to use products made in USA or other acceptable countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "16749  A Bit Biased One star so it stands out.. please read! \\nSo Samsung wasn't my first choice nor was Brandsmart. Samsung because of their reputation in recent years and Brandsmart because of their extended warranty issues in the past and their vendors.. let's see fingers crossed. \\nHowever, Brandsmart had THE BEST price in town. Brandsmarts' deal was sooo good I couldn't pass the Samsung's. I really got a great deal. Paid $1199.99 for the set. PLUS warranty and a couple of other things (hoses, etc).\\nPros: They're spectacular thus far. This model is loaded with features. FYI the washer DOES have a drum light but only on the 5.0 cu ft not the 4.5 cu ft. Only had these units a couple of weeks so we'll see if they stand the test of time. \\nCons: 1) YOU HAVE TO BUY the WiFi Samsung - Universal Smart Home Adapter\\nModel:HD2018GH ($25 each) to enjoy the alert features and so on. You can ONLY control the units if you press a specific button on the machine each time which defeats the purpose since you're already there to press it yourself. You CAN however monitor the units regardless without pressing any buttons..which I have to say saves time because you exactly when your load is done..\\n2) Setting up the WiFi was a major pain in the BUTT! I'm lucky that I do IT and was able to figure it out. Basically, you separate your 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.. so no band-steering on your router if you want these to work. They ONLY connect to 2.4 GHz.. make sure your network has different names on those frequencies so you're able to connect them. \\n\\nNote: If the washer makes a lot of noise on the spin cycle try adjusting the little rubber legs. Height, etc. It was really loud here and I was able to adjust reducing the noise almost to nothing. \\n\\nI must say Brandsmart lowered their price on this set and getting the credit adjusted was a breeze. I'm very happy with them so far and this entire process.                                                                                                   \n",
      "16841  great grouping round for Kimber 84L I have 2 Kimber 84L rifles and this shoots cloverleaf groups out of both of them, easily 3/4\" groups out of several different boxes.  Plus, keep your brass because if you decide to load later it'll save you $1.50/shot for Nosler brass (yes, I know its not the exact same but Nosler customer support says its close).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "17625  The best  mid-sized range bag, would buy again. Very well made range bag. Everything about it is well made and heavy -duty. Just the right size for 3 or 4 handguns, plus everything else you need for a day of fun & games. The zippers are the best , handles and shoulder strap are comfortable and sturdy. This bag is built to last, well designed, and easy to carry. I paid  for this bag @ ZORO than it was priced at the local gun store.

      "17852  Runs too Small I'm a bit disappointed in my first time trying NB shoes ever. I found this shoe looking fit latest best shoes for overpronation. Loved this color so I went with it. My toes were scrunched right up in the front of the shoe. I don't have an abnormally long toe or anything like that. I usually wear size 10, but this shoe is more like 9.75. I'm unsure if going a half size up would keep my same foot alignment/support where I need for overpronation.  The toe region also oddly seems to be missing support? Feels like there's no material between my toes and the ground, maybe some people like that, I don't.

      "18566  I would only buy it again when on sale! The Stamina Cutbacks that I recently purchased are only going to be used for casual wear.  Previous Stamina Cutbacks that I have purchased at retail stores where comfortable and I need a sneaker that is a wide fit.  However, it seems that the insoles do not have sufficient arch support so that I need to purchase a orthopedic grade insole that gives such support which adds another $50.00 to be able to wear the sneaker in complete comfort.  Also, if used for jogging the sneaker's tread wears out too fast in the heal area while the rest of the Stamina Cutback sneaker is still like new.   I put duck tape on the heel when it starts to wear down the black tread flat and starts to show the underneath white portion to get a little more life out of the sneaker since the rest is still like new.  I like the style and fit but they do not last long for running or jogging and need more arch support even though they are categorized as an athletic sneaker.  I only purchase them when on sale as I need to also purchase a better insole and the tread does not last long when used for jogging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "18694  Undisclosed Previous year I had purchased a full set of tires that cost  &#40;GoodYear&#41;, I had nothing but flat ties and each time I had to get it patch. After complaining of tires purchased and salesperson said I needed new tires, I then informed him I had just purchased them last year and according to what he life of tires was 65k miles and I only had 25k miles. Sales representative told me that tires I purchased were defective and that he would give me credit for new ones. So, I proceeded to get new set of different brands of tires, giving the benefit of the doubt it was a defect.  This visit I went in for a flat tire, salesperson stated that my tires need to be replaced because they were at 4/32. Salesperson check miles when new tires were purchase back January 2019 and the life of tires purchased were 65k miles and compared to what miles I had was only 23k miles. How is this company/ tire name promising x miles and life of tires and they are not living up to it? He said they would give me credit to purchase new tire.

      "18952  I would NEVER buy these again! We are VERY dissatisfied with the new cushions.  We will never buy them again.  They were more expensive 50.00 each thinking they would be better.  They sink when you sit on them.

      "21216  For a woman who lips were dry as a desert When I turned 35 years old, my lips started to get very dry. I was getting desperate because the cracks I had were painful, my lip skin was falling apart, UGH! Horrible! It made me feel down and sad. My lips  looked so horrible like if they were part of a horror movie. I used everything! From cheap lip moisturizers to expensive ones (over $ 20.00). Then when getting my favorite toner from Mamonde, I saw they had this in the Grab and Go at my local Ulta Store. I love Mamonde and so I gave it a try... and O.M.G.!!!\\n\\nIt was amazing!!! At first I felt my lips a bit tingled but in less than three days my lips looked healthy, smooth and hydrated!!! I use this lip balm from morning to night. \\n\\nWhen I start my morning skin care routine I apply the balm at the end step of my hydration process (before applying makeup/lipstick), after I remove my makeup/cleansing skin care routine and before going to bed. It last a lot, the glossy effect is something I love too, you can put any lippie on top of it, or use any lipstick to give it a tint. Or just go with the natural gloss of it.\\n\\nI have used it for over 4 weeks and still have good amount of product. The price is right for the results I got, and will continue to use it. Thank you Mamonde for this wonderful lip balm!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "23246  Its thin. Its so thin its drapery. Not insulated at all. You want $54.99 full price, then $24.99 for discount then when I purchased it, it was on clearance for $15.94 & thank god for that bc its not worth  its so cheap feeling, thin and really isnt anything more than fashion wear since its NOT insulated. Walmart and Target have cheaper priced and better quality brands! Everyone save urself the trouble and money. The only mildly okay thing with this vest is its true to size, maybe with a little wiggle room as its considered 'outdoor wear'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "23257  Soft & cozy My daughter really liked that socks go up on the calf & stay up. Most \"slipper-type\" socks slide down & get bunched. Tho calf elastic could be a little tight for some girls over age 13 or 125 lbs.  I bought 8 pair of the socks in Christmas designs as small gift for nieces.

      "24167  What you expect I received a full size jar of Renergie Lift Multi-action Ultra Face Cream With SPF 30 to try for my honest review. I tried the cream for 2 weeks, applying in the morning and before bed. It really left my skin feeling silky smooth. I did not see much difference in tightening on my face, but did see an improvment on my neck...after losing 20lbs the skin was lose and looked tired. This really helped in that area. I liked the smell as well. The only down side is the price. If this was 50.00 or less I would buy it on a regular basis....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "25242  If I could, would buy one in every color,! I have dress coats for church and community events, but I needed something for casual and sporty that was really warm for northern Michigan.

PS GOOD quality...too bad they don't fit and they cost too much to return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "26322  Loved the price until I removed the plastic wrap I thought this was an awesome deal for $2.99 and had bought myself a a total of 5 of these frames in different colors.  I was going to buy one as a gift for a friend.  But when I removed the plastic wrap, I saw small indent or bubble imperfections in a couple of them.  I did not or could not see those imperfections through the plastic wrap or I would not have purchased them.  Luckily, of the ones I kept and am using, they sit on a shelf where people cannot get too close and hopefully will never notice the glass imperfections.  But I would have been embarrassed if one I gave as a gift had the same imperfection.  Overall, still a decent frame for a situation like mine and for the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
      "26422  It isn't worth the money! Before even getting this paid off, it is unraveling!! Very cheap materials and very cheaply made. I purchased it for my room,  the smaller rugs are used in the hall and the kitchen. I'm not sure about removing stains but as it is falling apart now, it will be trashed soon enough.Wearing high heels, playing games on it or having a pet in the home... forget these rugs! $134.00 total and 2 months old? What a waste of money 😭😭😭... Also, since it is made of cheap plastic polyester type material, DO NOT USE around open flames!

      "26876  Weekly Appointment Book Reorder #70-008, dimensions 3\"x6.25\".  For decades I have used this pocket calendar, with a black leather cover, address book insert and blank pad insert.  The store from which I bought inserts yearly lost its lease.  Office Depot has no refills and I cannot find anyone who sells them.  I should not have to buy a whole new product every year;  I just the insert(s)!

      "27522  Very nice saw, starts easy saws fast. One small problem We had a derecho (A line of intense, widespread, and fast-moving windstorms and sometimes thunderstorms that moves across a great distance and is characterized by damaging winds.) in eastern Iowa on 08/10/2020. Chain saws were hard to find. I found this at Ace Hardware. They had one left and delivered it to my truck curbside. Great people to do business with. We used it quite a bit at first but had to get a saw with 26\" bar. Unfortunately the chain adjuster on 16\" Craftsman is not like the older saws. It is a slotted head shaft with a gear at the end. That gear turns a geared head on what I would call the screw that turns the boss that tightens the bar. It would eventually strip both gears enough that you could not tighten the chain and bar. This \"Rube Goldberg\" design makes tightening the chain a chore. Instead of a straight screw and a boss to tighten the chain we have a 90 degree gear and pinion that get worn and sloppy. Said gear and pinion tightener is not sold separately. You have to replace the entire clutch assembly. I ordered one on 12/21/2020 from MTD Parts as MTD makes the saw for Craftsman $254.07 shipped to my door but the part is back ordered until the last week in January! Who thought and engineered  this foolish chain adjuster? Probably the same team who came up with \"New Coke Coca Cola.\" Now I gotta go refill my wind bag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "28487  Great for the price and cute print I got these on sale, so this review is based on paying $1.25 per mask. These are triple layer, which is what the CDC is recommended for cloth face masks now (December 2020), so that's nice. The fabric options are also great, and the adjustable ear loops are handy. I will say these are HUGE. They cover above the nose basically down to the neck, which is good for coverage, but kind of annoying on my face. I bought the kid size, too, and they still cover my nose and mouth just fine, so a size in between would be great. I have not washed yet, though, and other reviews say they shrink. I typically handwash masks, though. The addition of a metal nose piece would help immensely, but again, these were super cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "29274  Received incorrect items, no recourse from Shutterfly to cor I paid extra to purchase preaddressed envelopes to go with our Christmas cards this year. I received 60 envelopes that were preaddressed with someone else's name and address. When I contacted customer service I was informed that they would not replace the envelopes with corrected ones. The only recourse I was offered was a promo code for the purchase of preaddressed envelopes. You cannot purchase envelopes on their own through Shutterfly. They are only available as an add on to a card purchase. In addition, my promo code expires within the month so I can't even apply towards a future card purchase. So I paid roughly $100 for custom printed cards and envelopes that arrived incorrect and then I was informed that my only option was to buy a new set of cards with new envelopes and Shutterfly would cover the $17.40 cost for addressing those new envelopes, but not the $81 for the cards (which in reality would have been far higher because I used a now expired coupon code for 40% off). I will no longer be a Shutterfly customer after this experience. I have used this service for over 10 years for everything from Christmas cards to my wedding albums. My customer service experience this holiday season left me disappointed, angry, and having to scramble to find envelopes that matched in size and color somewhere else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "29947  Purchased 11/19, on sale for  now... So I purchased a few items on 11/19, and now these jeans are  than the price I paid. I chatted with someone at Duluth and was told since more than 7 days has passed and I already received them at a sales price back on 11/19, there was nothing they could do. Is it just me, or should they honor the lowered price three weeks later?

      "31177  I would not buy any product from Singer ever again. I ordered a Singer Patchwork Sewing and QUILTING Machine, you sent a regular Sewing Machine. Your ad has both items listed by side. You emailed the order confirmation at once. It took 3 days  and 2 emails from me to obtain delivery date and tracking number. The product arrived, but you sent the wrong item. I requested a shipping label from you, after 2 more requests without a word from you , I decided to return the product back to you and paid out of pocket $30.70 to ship it back to you. The shipping label arrived too late! I got multiple excuses from you and always suggesting that the fault was on my behalf. Please refer to emails to confirm my statements. I have been reimbursed $199.99 , but the $30.70 is still unpaid. I believe that singer should pay this amount to me immediately. My experience dealing with Singer has been overwhelmingly painful and expensive, yes, $30.70 worth.  My pride and purse attest witness to that. In case you decide to pay me back my address is Myra Fresquez PO Box 1801 Guymon Oklahoma 73942                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "951    Good rifle / poor magazine fit - Problem Solved! I thoroughly enjoy the weight and pointability of this 16\" barreled Ruger in 300 BLK. However, not only was the action very rough from the onset, but one could not cycle the action over an empty magazine due to the mag keeper physically blocking the bolt! (Note - I love P-mags in my AR platforms, but the Ruger factory issued 5.56 cal P-mag delivered with this .300 BLK Ruger rifle was the cause of the \"rough action!) ... I purchased and installed an after-market, METAL, 10 round, 300 BLK  (7.62x 39)  \"ASC brand\" magazine and this solved both problems. The bolt cycled noticeably smoother with the ASC magazine, plus i could now easily close the bolt over an empty mag. The difference this magazine swap made with the rifle's functionality is amazing. This was an inexpensive fix and saved me from selling my newly acquired Ruger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "1804   Does what it says! I have been through numerous flat irons (from $29.00 up to $300 brands) and they all ended up making my hair smell burned.  Since I have very thick, wavy hair I have to put it on the highest settings.  Still, I have to pass it through so many times that my wrist ends up cramping way before I'm done!  This one works on the first pass and with no burning smell.

      "3590   LIFE CHANGER (for your eyes, anyway!) I received a 0.17 oz tube from a friend about 7 months ago and I'll get easily another month out of it! I'm here to reorder (cannot bear the idea of running out!) the full size, and one for a friend.\\nI have tried dozens of shadow primers, and until I used this product, I had no idea what a primer COULD and SHOULD do. It's a thicker formula than I've ever tried - I \"pat\" in on gently before smoothing it out. Women have asked me how I keep my eyeshadow perfect all day, no matter if I'm sweating, at work, or up all night....and I'm more than happy to tell! I have actually gone THREE days/2 (sleeping) nights (don't ask), and while the rest of my makeup looked worn out, my eyes looked GREAT!\\n\\nI'll be sure to add photos later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

What a scam, there was a reason why I stayed away from Pampered Chef for so long!!!!!!!!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "4669   DISAPPOINTED with Lucky Brand I'd been waiting for this jacket to go on sale & ordered a medium on 11/15 when it went on sale for $71.40. Received an email on 11/17 that the order was fulfilled & had shipped but I NEVER RECEIVED, I was refunded though. When I checked online it showed there were 5 small left in stock, so I called Lucky Brand to order in that size but was told even though the website reflected that, it was actually out of stock. Not the first time this has happened to me from this company, apparently inventory control & customer service isn't of importance anymore!

      "5445   Absolutely would buy again Ok, so let me go ahead and say I'm going to \"water off\" people out there (i.e. hunters and competition shooters). I have been handloading my ammo for 39 years.  Started in in 1980.  Didn't know much then, I had a Lee Loader in .44 magnum, .45-70, and .30-30.  You guys that get free coffee at Hardees know what a Lee Loader is.  Back then I used to load Sierra Matchkings for my Remington model 788 in .30-30, not because they shot good (which they did) but because I like the way they looked.  Since that time I have owned hundreds of rifles in a lot of calibers and I always go back to Sierra Matchking bullets \"IF\" I want to know what a rifle is capable of.  I just had take a refresher course on that.  I purchased 2 boxes of 142 grain Accubonds, and a box of 143 grain ELD-X bullets, working up a load for my 6.5 Creedmoor.  I was disappointed to see that my RCBS dies slightly damaged the Accubonds and Eld-X bullets.  To my dismay, I spent $192.00 on Redding Competition dies and a VLD bullet seater.  Needless to say, I was not completely satisfied with the accuracy results.  In an act of desperation, I grabbed a box of 140 grain Sierra Matchking bullets, a pound of R19 powder, as H4350 is no where to be found, and began working up a load following online Sierra load data.  The end result was an outstanding group at 300 yards with R19 and Sierra 140 grain Matchking bullets.  Furthermore, I worked up a load with the Accubonds and it wouldn't come close to the SMK's in \"My Ruger Precision Rifle\".  And now to \"Water off\" the rest of the bunch.  I've been hunting with Sierra Matchking bullets for years and never lost a whitetail to this day.  Would I shoot elk, or bear with one?  Probably not, but I have never lost a deer yet that I've shot with a SMK.  Matter of fact, killed 3 this year and all fell in their tracks.  So take this bit of advise, before you waste powder, primers, bullets, AND money, just see what your rifle is \"Capable of\" with SMK's.   \n",

      "6418   Quality palette! I have been looking for this color story in an affordable palette for a while. After reading the reviews & watching some YouTube videos & reviews on the Nudist palette I decided to get it during a BOGO sale & using the . It is definitely worth full price. The dark colors are so blendable, and pigmented. I created a beautiful eye look in less than 5 mins. It works better than a lot of my more expensive palettes. I did have to reach into my singles for a lid shade. The shimmers didn't have enough pop for the look I was going for, but good enough for every day looks. I would recommend this palette, for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "6559   Durable, Comfortable and They Look Nice. The rating should be a 4.5 or 4.75, but such subtleties are not allowed. This is my fourth pair of Invincibles in as many years and the first pair, except for some sun fading, is still very serviceable. The fit is comfortable, the length provides coverage without restriction and the built in brief provides just the right amount of support.    The side pockets are very handy for carrying a number of items, in my case, an iphone as I listen to podcasts when I walk.  The side pockets are the one feature that prevents me from giving these shorts the best score. On the older model shorts, the side pockets allow about an 1\" or 1.5\" of the phone to protrude above the pocket, so the phone was secure, but also easy to extract if the need arose. On the newer models, the pocket envelops the whole phone and the strength of the velcro plus having to \"fish\" for the phone makes it more difficult to extract.  This is, to be sure, a minor issue, and will not deter me from ordering another pair in the near future as these are my go to shorts anytime the temperature is above 45 degrees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "7587   Love the Blazer but Not the NEW PRICE I purchased this blazer on October 10, on SALE for 39.99 and with my promo coupon, paid 33.99 for it. It has no buttons but that can easily be fixed if you want to spend a few more bucks. It goes great with jeans. PROBLEM -- It troubles me when I decided to log in on the Sunday after Black Friday and go surfing the Clearance section to see what I can purchase and come across this exact same blazer being sold for $59.98. WHAT IS THAT? THAT IS PRICE GOUGING! I am so disappointed with Banana Republic right now and I truly do not want to hear a lame excuse about how it was some special deal, bc BLACK FRIDAY DEALS are suppose to be one of the best.

My sneakers were regular price 75$ but because you took 1 penny off and made them 74.99 I didn't qualify for shipping. I tried to call customer service and you were closed... not good at all... if I didn't need the sneakers as bad as I do I wouldn't purchase through you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
      "9252   Not 2.5\" heel. Only 1.25\" I returned them because it says  \"1 1/2 inch heel height, 2 1/2 total heel height with wedge fit\"  . The heel is 1.25\" PERIOD. It is not 2.5\" and there is no wedge fit. I bought them because I wanted a 2.5\" heel. The description is wrong and I am waiting for my refund. Disappointed they do not have the description correct.

I emailed multiple times but no one ever answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "9532   Shipping $4 on an $8 mag? How do you charge at least  per mag on an $8 mag? I was going to order 4 just to try out but $16.95 on $32 worth of magazines that weigh less than a pound total is highway robbery. Keep them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "9878   Very unsatisfied service I had two items that missed the delivery date and was assured I would receive 150 dollars plus 10 percent off the purchase.  My purchase order invoice was over 3000.00.  Because no other information was given I anticipated an approximate amount of 450.00.  I got told at the end of delivery under half that amount and then was hung up on.  I have not received any compensation and it has been 6 days.

      "11011  What a rip-off I bought this for a gift.  It was WAY too small (same size I had bought in other styles).  I paid EXTRA $$ to have it arrive on time for a birthday gift (2-day shipping) and it arrived 7 days afterwards.  When I exchanged it to get the proper size and have it shipped directly to my sister, they treated it as a return and deducted $5.00 from the purchase price plus all the extra shipping I paid.  In the end I was out $15.  I will never purchase another item from this vendor.

      "11522  I would buy this product again for this low price . I love Oakley sunglasses, and haven't owned any in about 30 years cause they are so expensive.When Midway USA had this special for $54.00 I jumped on it and bought me and my wife a pair. My wife had never owned a pair of Oakley's , and would never pay even $54.00 for a pair , so I surprised her with them and she loves them .Thanks Larry Potterfield for the sale price ,  Mick & Karen Hartgrove                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "11614  Yes I was forced to buy this cutter after purchasing Midsouth's once fired 6.5mm Creedmoor brass.  All the brass was longer than the overall case length size of 1.920\".  That said I have used the 3 in 1 for 22 caliber, 6mm, and 30 caliber cases.  It is an outstanding product.  With trimming and chamfering both the outside and the inside of the case at the same time it saves much effort and time in case preparation.  Of course a Forster case trimmer is required.  I have a Forster attachment to the trimmer that allows me to use my hand drill to automate the process and save my hand.  For trimming many lengthened cases I would not be without it.  I also pick up range brass in 5.56 and the cases most always exceed the maximum case length.  Processing hundreds of cases is an easy chore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "11644  Absolutely WORTH it!! I kind of balked a little at the price at first. I mean who spends 140.00 on a pillow even an organic one??  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this pillow and it is absolutely the best one I have ever owned. I hope it isn't like most pillows and.

      "14067  I would buy again but only in one color-not both Very sharp boot- ordered both black and brown when they were on sale for $80.  But still not sure I received such a great deal, and would prefer if they were a bit taller, and hit mid knee which is a more flattering height.  With all that said, they are extremely comfortable with a nice rubber sole that adds to that comfort.  The heel shape is great too-larger which adds to walking stability and creates a more casual look. I'll wear these for many years to come.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because I prefer if they were longer which is a more flattering look, and I would have preferred paying a lower price than the 79.95 final sale from Dillards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

I didn't expect to have to assemble a 600.00 sideboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
      "15520  Do not get this sectional!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We bought this sectional sofa four months ago. We also purchased the ottoman and the recliner with it and it is awful quality! It has ripped in several places. Not just the sofa but the ottoman and the recliner. Terrible product! It shouldn't even be sold! We spent $1200.00 on everything and if you make a purchase that big and especially it being furniture for your living room it should not tear up in four months! I wish I had my money back and I could get something else that is better quality! Very dissatisfied! DO NOT GET THIS!!! I had also ordered everything and when I got to the store they had sold my recliner to someone else so we ended up having to get the one on the floor which was the last one they had! My opinion we should be able to take it back and show them how bad it has torn apart and they should refund our money or let us pick anything else out that we want! I'm not even going to mention how many times we had to return to the store after we got home and parts were missing and the first one we bought we came home set everything up only to find that there was a RIP in the one we brought home from the store so we went back and they gave us a new one and four months later it's tearing up everywhere!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "16455  Not working less than 6 months time Using daily at least.  Had it since about Jan of this year.  I purchased at Dollar General in Bellville, TX.  It didn't work this morning at all, so I assumed I used up the batteries.  Changed same noting the correct position, and still does not come on, make a noise, nothing.  I am so angry.  Yes I only paid $7.50 but I could have bought a lot more batteries for that amount.  I really think I should at least be able to send in and get a new one, in exchange.  This is another typical reason why we should start paying attention to all the Chinese products.  And Dollar General would not exist if it had to use products made in USA or other acceptable countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "16749  A Bit Biased One star so it stands out.. please read! \\nSo Samsung wasn't my first choice nor was Brandsmart. Samsung because of their reputation in recent years and Brandsmart because of their extended warranty issues in the past and their vendors.. let's see fingers crossed. \\nHowever, Brandsmart had THE BEST price in town. Brandsmarts' deal was sooo good I couldn't pass the Samsung's. I really got a great deal. Paid $1199.99 for the set. PLUS warranty and a couple of other things (hoses, etc).\\nPros: They're spectacular thus far. This model is loaded with features. FYI the washer DOES have a drum light but only on the 5.0 cu ft not the 4.5 cu ft. Only had these units a couple of weeks so we'll see if they stand the test of time. \\nCons: 1) YOU HAVE TO BUY the WiFi Samsung - Universal Smart Home Adapter\\nModel:HD2018GH ($25 each) to enjoy the alert features and so on. You can ONLY control the units if you press a specific button on the machine each time which defeats the purpose since you're already there to press it yourself. You CAN however monitor the units regardless without pressing any buttons..which I have to say saves time because you exactly when your load is done..\\n2) Setting up the WiFi was a major pain in the BUTT! I'm lucky that I do IT and was able to figure it out. Basically, you separate your 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.. so no band-steering on your router if you want these to work. They ONLY connect to 2.4 GHz.. make sure your network has different names on those frequencies so you're able to connect them. \\n\\nNote: If the washer makes a lot of noise on the spin cycle try adjusting the little rubber legs. Height, etc. It was really loud here and I was able to adjust reducing the noise almost to nothing. \\n\\nI must say Brandsmart lowered their price on this set and getting the credit adjusted was a breeze. I'm very happy with them so far and this entire process.                                                                                                   \n",
      "16841  great grouping round for Kimber 84L I have 2 Kimber 84L rifles and this shoots cloverleaf groups out of both of them, easily 3/4\" groups out of several different boxes.  Plus, keep your brass because if you decide to load later it'll save you $1.50/shot for Nosler brass (yes, I know its not the exact same but Nosler customer support says its close).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "17625  The best  mid-sized range bag, would buy again. Very well made range bag. Everything about it is well made and heavy -duty. Just the right size for 3 or 4 handguns, plus everything else you need for a day of fun & games. The zippers are the best , handles and shoulder strap are comfortable and sturdy. This bag is built to last, well designed, and easy to carry. I paid  for this bag @ ZORO than it was priced at the local gun store.

      "17852  Runs too Small I'm a bit disappointed in my first time trying NB shoes ever. I found this shoe looking fit latest best shoes for overpronation. Loved this color so I went with it. My toes were scrunched right up in the front of the shoe. I don't have an abnormally long toe or anything like that. I usually wear size 10, but this shoe is more like 9.75. I'm unsure if going a half size up would keep my same foot alignment/support where I need for overpronation.  The toe region also oddly seems to be missing support? Feels like there's no material between my toes and the ground, maybe some people like that, I don't.

      "18566  I would only buy it again when on sale! The Stamina Cutbacks that I recently purchased are only going to be used for casual wear.  Previous Stamina Cutbacks that I have purchased at retail stores where comfortable and I need a sneaker that is a wide fit.  However, it seems that the insoles do not have sufficient arch support so that I need to purchase a orthopedic grade insole that gives such support which adds another $50.00 to be able to wear the sneaker in complete comfort.  Also, if used for jogging the sneaker's tread wears out too fast in the heal area while the rest of the Stamina Cutback sneaker is still like new.   I put duck tape on the heel when it starts to wear down the black tread flat and starts to show the underneath white portion to get a little more life out of the sneaker since the rest is still like new.  I like the style and fit but they do not last long for running or jogging and need more arch support even though they are categorized as an athletic sneaker.  I only purchase them when on sale as I need to also purchase a better insole and the tread does not last long when used for jogging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "18694  Undisclosed Previous year I had purchased a full set of tires that cost  &#40;GoodYear&#41;, I had nothing but flat ties and each time I had to get it patch. After complaining of tires purchased and salesperson said I needed new tires, I then informed him I had just purchased them last year and according to what he life of tires was 65k miles and I only had 25k miles. Sales representative told me that tires I purchased were defective and that he would give me credit for new ones. So, I proceeded to get new set of different brands of tires, giving the benefit of the doubt it was a defect.  This visit I went in for a flat tire, salesperson stated that my tires need to be replaced because they were at 4/32. Salesperson check miles when new tires were purchase back January 2019 and the life of tires purchased were 65k miles and compared to what miles I had was only 23k miles. How is this company/ tire name promising x miles and life of tires and they are not living up to it? He said they would give me credit to purchase new tire.

      "18952  I would NEVER buy these again! We are VERY dissatisfied with the new cushions.  We will never buy them again.  They were more expensive 50.00 each thinking they would be better.  They sink when you sit on them.

      "21216  For a woman who lips were dry as a desert When I turned 35 years old, my lips started to get very dry. I was getting desperate because the cracks I had were painful, my lip skin was falling apart, UGH! Horrible! It made me feel down and sad. My lips  looked so horrible like if they were part of a horror movie. I used everything! From cheap lip moisturizers to expensive ones (over $ 20.00). Then when getting my favorite toner from Mamonde, I saw they had this in the Grab and Go at my local Ulta Store. I love Mamonde and so I gave it a try... and O.M.G.!!!\\n\\nIt was amazing!!! At first I felt my lips a bit tingled but in less than three days my lips looked healthy, smooth and hydrated!!! I use this lip balm from morning to night. \\n\\nWhen I start my morning skin care routine I apply the balm at the end step of my hydration process (before applying makeup/lipstick), after I remove my makeup/cleansing skin care routine and before going to bed. It last a lot, the glossy effect is something I love too, you can put any lippie on top of it, or use any lipstick to give it a tint. Or just go with the natural gloss of it.\\n\\nI have used it for over 4 weeks and still have good amount of product. The price is right for the results I got, and will continue to use it. Thank you Mamonde for this wonderful lip balm!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "23246  Its thin. Its so thin its drapery. Not insulated at all. You want $54.99 full price, then $24.99 for discount then when I purchased it, it was on clearance for $15.94 & thank god for that bc its not worth  its so cheap feeling, thin and really isnt anything more than fashion wear since its NOT insulated. Walmart and Target have cheaper priced and better quality brands! Everyone save urself the trouble and money. The only mildly okay thing with this vest is its true to size, maybe with a little wiggle room as its considered 'outdoor wear'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "23257  Soft & cozy My daughter really liked that socks go up on the calf & stay up. Most \"slipper-type\" socks slide down & get bunched. Tho calf elastic could be a little tight for some girls over age 13 or 125 lbs.  I bought 8 pair of the socks in Christmas designs as small gift for nieces.

      "24167  What you expect I received a full size jar of Renergie Lift Multi-action Ultra Face Cream With SPF 30 to try for my honest review. I tried the cream for 2 weeks, applying in the morning and before bed. It really left my skin feeling silky smooth. I did not see much difference in tightening on my face, but did see an improvment on my neck...after losing 20lbs the skin was lose and looked tired. This really helped in that area. I liked the smell as well. The only down side is the price. If this was 50.00 or less I would buy it on a regular basis....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

PS GOOD quality...too bad they don't fit and they cost too much to return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "26322  Loved the price until I removed the plastic wrap I thought this was an awesome deal for $2.99 and had bought myself a a total of 5 of these frames in different colors.  I was going to buy one as a gift for a friend.  But when I removed the plastic wrap, I saw small indent or bubble imperfections in a couple of them.  I did not or could not see those imperfections through the plastic wrap or I would not have purchased them.  Luckily, of the ones I kept and am using, they sit on a shelf where people cannot get too close and hopefully will never notice the glass imperfections.  But I would have been embarrassed if one I gave as a gift had the same imperfection.  Overall, still a decent frame for a situation like mine and for the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
      "26422  It isn't worth the money! Before even getting this paid off, it is unraveling!! Very cheap materials and very cheaply made. I purchased it for my room,  the smaller rugs are used in the hall and the kitchen. I'm not sure about removing stains but as it is falling apart now, it will be trashed soon enough.Wearing high heels, playing games on it or having a pet in the home... forget these rugs! $134.00 total and 2 months old? What a waste of money 😭😭😭... Also, since it is made of cheap plastic polyester type material, DO NOT USE around open flames!

      "26876  Weekly Appointment Book Reorder #70-008, dimensions 3\"x6.25\".  For decades I have used this pocket calendar, with a black leather cover, address book insert and blank pad insert.  The store from which I bought inserts yearly lost its lease.  Office Depot has no refills and I cannot find anyone who sells them.  I should not have to buy a whole new product every year;  I just the insert(s)!

      "27522  Very nice saw, starts easy saws fast. One small problem We had a derecho (A line of intense, widespread, and fast-moving windstorms and sometimes thunderstorms that moves across a great distance and is characterized by damaging winds.) in eastern Iowa on 08/10/2020. Chain saws were hard to find. I found this at Ace Hardware. They had one left and delivered it to my truck curbside. Great people to do business with. We used it quite a bit at first but had to get a saw with 26\" bar. Unfortunately the chain adjuster on 16\" Craftsman is not like the older saws. It is a slotted head shaft with a gear at the end. That gear turns a geared head on what I would call the screw that turns the boss that tightens the bar. It would eventually strip both gears enough that you could not tighten the chain and bar. This \"Rube Goldberg\" design makes tightening the chain a chore. Instead of a straight screw and a boss to tighten the chain we have a 90 degree gear and pinion that get worn and sloppy. Said gear and pinion tightener is not sold separately. You have to replace the entire clutch assembly. I ordered one on 12/21/2020 from MTD Parts as MTD makes the saw for Craftsman ped to my door but the part is back ordered until the last week in January! Who thought and engineered  this foolish chain adjuster? Probably the same team who came up with \"New Coke Coca Cola.\" Now I gotta go refill my wind bag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

      "28487  Great for the price and cute print I got these on sale, so this review is based on paying $1.25 per mask. These are triple layer, which is what the CDC is recommended for cloth face masks now (December 2020), so that's nice. The fabric options are also great, and the adjustable ear loops are handy. I will say these are HUGE. They cover above the nose basically down to the neck, which is good for coverage, but kind of annoying on my face. I bought the kid size, too, and they still cover my nose and mouth just fine, so a size in between would be great. I have not washed yet, though, and other reviews say they shrink. I typically handwash masks, though. The addition of a metal nose piece would help immensely, but again, these were super cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "29274  Received incorrect items, no recourse from Shutterfly to cor I paid extra to purchase preaddressed envelopes to go with our Christmas cards this year. I received 60 envelopes that were preaddressed with someone else's name and address. When I contacted customer service I was informed that they would not replace the envelopes with corrected ones. The only recourse I was offered was a promo code for the purchase of preaddressed envelopes. You cannot purchase envelopes on their own through Shutterfly. They are only available as an add on to a card purchase. In addition, my promo code expires within the month so I can't even apply towards a future card purchase. So I paid roughly $100 for custom printed cards and envelopes that arrived incorrect and then I was informed that my only option was to buy a new set of cards with new envelopes and Shutterfly would cover the $17.40 cost for addressing those new envelopes, but not the $81 for the cards (which in reality would have been far higher because I used a now expired coupon code for 40% off). I will no longer be a Shutterfly customer after this experience. I have used this service for over 10 years for everything from Christmas cards to my wedding albums. My customer service experience this holiday season left me disappointed, angry, and having to scramble to find envelopes that matched in size and color somewhere else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "29947  Purchased 11/19, on sale for  now... So I purchased a few items on 11/19, and now these jeans are  than the price I paid. I chatted with someone at Duluth and was told since more than 7 days has passed and I already received them at a sales price back on 11/19, there was nothing they could do. Is it just me, or should they honor the lowered price three weeks later?

      "31177  I would not buy any product from Singer ever again. I ordered a Singer Patchwork Sewing and QUILTING Machine, you sent a regular Sewing Machine. Your ad has both items listed by side. You emailed the order confirmation at once. It took 3 days  and 2 emails from me to obtain delivery date and tracking number. The product arrived, but you sent the wrong item. I requested a shipping label from you, after 2 more requests without a word from you , I decided to return the product back to you and paid out of pocket  it back to you. The shipping label arrived too late! I got multiple excuses from you and always suggesting that the fault was on my behalf. Please refer to emails to confirm my statements. I have been reimbursed $199.99 , but the $30.70 is still unpaid. I believe that singer should pay this amount to me immediately. My experience dealing with Singer has been overwhelmingly painful and expensive, yes, $30.70 worth.  My pride and purse attest witness to that. In case you decide to pay me back my address is Myra Fresquez PO Box 1801 Guymon Oklahoma 73942                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

      "951    Good rifle / poor magazine fit - Problem Solved! I thoroughly enjoy the weight and pointability of this 16\" barreled Ruger in 300 BLK. However, not only was the action very rough from the onset, but one could not cycle the action over an empty magazine due to the mag keeper physically blocking the bolt! (Note - I love P-mags in my AR platforms, but the Ruger factory issued 5.56 cal P-mag delivered with this .300 BLK Ruger rifle was the cause of the \"rough action!) ... I purchased and installed an after-market, METAL, 10 round, 300 BLK  (7.62x 39)  \"ASC brand\" magazine and this solved both problems. The bolt cycled noticeably smoother with the ASC magazine, plus i could now easily close the bolt over an empty mag. The difference this magazine swap made with the rifle's functionality is amazing. This was an inexpensive fix and saved me from selling my newly acquired Ruger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "1804   Does what it says! I have been through numerous flat irons (from $29.00 up to $300 brands) and they all ended up making my hair smell burned.  Since I have very thick, wavy hair I have to put it on the highest settings.  Still, I have to pass it through so many times that my wrist ends up cramping way before I'm done!  This one works on the first pass and with no burning smell.

      "3590   LIFE CHANGER (for your eyes, anyway!) I received a 0.17 oz tube from a friend about 7 months ago and I'll get easily another month out of it! I'm here to reorder (cannot bear the idea of running out!) the full size, and one for a friend.\\nI have tried dozens of shadow primers, and until I used this product, I had no idea what a primer COULD and SHOULD do. It's a thicker formula than I've ever tried - I \"pat\" in on gently before smoothing it out. Women have asked me how I keep my eyeshadow perfect all day, no matter if I'm sweating, at work, or up all night....and I'm more than happy to tell! I have actually gone THREE days/2 (sleeping) nights (don't ask), and while the rest of my makeup looked worn out, my eyes looked GREAT!\\n\\nI'll be sure to add photos later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

What a scam, there was a reason why I stayed away from Pampered Chef for so long!!!!!!!!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "4669   DISAPPOINTED with Lucky Brand I'd been waiting for this jacket to go on sale & ordered a medium on 11/15 when it went on sale for $71.40. Received an email on 11/17 that the order was fulfilled & had shipped but I NEVER RECEIVED, I was refunded though. When I checked online it showed there were 5 small left in stock, so I called Lucky Brand to order in that size but was told even though the website reflected that, it was actually out of stock. Not the first time this has happened to me from this company, apparently inventory control & customer service isn't of importance anymore!

      "5445   Absolutely would buy again Ok, so let me go ahead and say I'm going to \"water off\" people out there (i.e. hunters and competition shooters). I have been handloading my ammo for 39 years.  Started in in 1980.  Didn't know much then, I had a Lee Loader in .44 magnum, .45-70, and .30-30.  You guys that get free coffee at Hardees know what a Lee Loader is.  Back then I used to load Sierra Matchkings for my Remington model 788 in .30-30, not because they shot good (which they did) but because I like the way they looked.  Since that time I have owned hundreds of rifles in a lot of calibers and I always go back to Sierra Matchking bullets \"IF\" I want to know what a rifle is capable of.  I just had take a refresher course on that.  I purchased 2 boxes of 142 grain Accubonds, and a box of 143 grain ELD-X bullets, working up a load for my 6.5 Creedmoor.  I was disappointed to see that my RCBS dies slightly damaged the Accubonds and Eld-X bullets.  To my dismay, I spent $192.00 on Redding Competition dies and a VLD bullet seater.  Needless to say, I was not completely satisfied with the accuracy results.  In an act of desperation, I grabbed a box of 140 grain Sierra Matchking bullets, a pound of R19 powder, as H4350 is no where to be found, and began working up a load following online Sierra load data.  The end result was an outstanding group at 300 yards with R19 and Sierra 140 grain Matchking bullets.  Furthermore, I worked up a load with the Accubonds and it wouldn't come close to the SMK's in \"My Ruger Precision Rifle\".  And now to \"Water off\" the rest of the bunch.  I've been hunting with Sierra Matchking bullets for years and never lost a whitetail to this day.  Would I shoot elk, or bear with one?  Probably not, but I have never lost a deer yet that I've shot with a SMK.  Matter of fact, killed 3 this year and all fell in their tracks.  So take this bit of advise, before you waste powder, primers, bullets, AND money, just see what your rifle is \"Capable of\" with SMK's.   \n",

      "6418   Quality palette! I have been looking for this color story in an affordable palette for a while. After reading the reviews & watching some YouTube videos & reviews on the Nudist palette I decided to get it during a BOGO sale & using the . It is definitely worth full price. The dark colors are so blendable, and pigmented. I created a beautiful eye look in less than 5 mins. It works better than a lot of my more expensive palettes. I did have to reach into my singles for a lid shade. The shimmers didn't have enough pop for the look I was going for, but good enough for every day looks. I would recommend this palette, for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "6559   Durable, Comfortable and They Look Nice. The rating should be a 4.5 or 4.75, but such subtleties are not allowed. This is my fourth pair of Invincibles in as many years and the first pair, except for some sun fading, is still very serviceable. The fit is comfortable, the length provides coverage without restriction and the built in brief provides just the right amount of support.    The side pockets are very handy for carrying a number of items, in my case, an iphone as I listen to podcasts when I walk.  The side pockets are the one feature that prevents me from giving these shorts the best score. On the older model shorts, the side pockets allow about an 1\" or 1.5\" of the phone to protrude above the pocket, so the phone was secure, but also easy to extract if the need arose. On the newer models, the pocket envelops the whole phone and the strength of the velcro plus having to \"fish\" for the phone makes it more difficult to extract.  This is, to be sure, a minor issue, and will not deter me from ordering another pair in the near future as these are my go to shorts anytime the temperature is above 45 degrees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "7587   Love the Blazer but Not the NEW PRICE I purchased this blazer on October 10, on SALE for 39.99 and with my promo coupon, paid 33.99 for it. It has no buttons but that can easily be fixed if you want to spend a few more bucks. It goes great with jeans. PROBLEM -- It troubles me when I decided to log in on the Sunday after Black Friday and go surfing the Clearance section to see what I can purchase and come across this exact same blazer being sold for $59.98. WHAT IS THAT? THAT IS PRICE GOUGING! I am so disappointed with Banana Republic right now and I truly do not want to hear a lame excuse about how it was some special deal, bc BLACK FRIDAY DEALS are suppose to be one of the best.

My sneakers were regular price 75$ but because you took 1 penny off and made them 74.99 I didn't qualify for shipping. I tried to call customer service and you were closed... not good at all... if I didn't need the sneakers as bad as I do I wouldn't purchase through you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
      "9252   Not 2.5\" heel. Only 1.25\" I returned them because it says  \"1 1/2 inch heel height, 2 1/2 total heel height with wedge fit\"  . The heel is 1.25\" PERIOD. It is not 2.5\" and there is no wedge fit. I bought them because I wanted a 2.5\" heel. The description is wrong and I am waiting for my refund. Disappointed they do not have the description correct.

I emailed multiple times but no one ever answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "9532   Shipping $4 on an $8 mag? How do you charge at least  per mag on an $8 mag? I was going to order 4 just to try out but $16.95 on $32 worth of magazines that weigh less than a pound total is highway robbery. Keep them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "9878   Very unsatisfied service I had two items that missed the delivery date and was assured I would receive 150 dollars plus 10 percent off the purchase.  My purchase order invoice was over 3000.00.  Because no other information was given I anticipated an approximate amount of 450.00.  I got told at the end of delivery under half that amount and then was hung up on.  I have not received any compensation and it has been 6 days.

      "11011  What a rip-off I bought this for a gift.  It was WAY too small (same size I had bought in other styles).  I paid EXTRA $$ to have it arrive on time for a birthday gift (2-day shipping) and it arrived 7 days afterwards.  When I exchanged it to get the proper size and have it shipped directly to my sister, they treated it as a return and deducted $5.00 from the purchase price plus all the extra shipping I paid.  In the end I was out $15.  I will never purchase another item from this vendor.

      "11522  I would buy this product again for this low price . I love Oakley sunglasses, and haven't owned any in about 30 years cause they are so expensive.When Midway USA had this special for $54.00 I jumped on it and bought me and my wife a pair. My wife had never owned a pair of Oakley's , and would never pay even $54.00 for a pair , so I surprised her with them and she loves them .Thanks Larry Potterfield for the sale price ,  Mick & Karen Hartgrove                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "11614  Yes I was forced to buy this cutter after purchasing Midsouth's once fired 6.5mm Creedmoor brass.  All the brass was longer than the overall case length size of 1.920\".  That said I have used the 3 in 1 for 22 caliber, 6mm, and 30 caliber cases.  It is an outstanding product.  With trimming and chamfering both the outside and the inside of the case at the same time it saves much effort and time in case preparation.  Of course a Forster case trimmer is required.  I have a Forster attachment to the trimmer that allows me to use my hand drill to automate the process and save my hand.  For trimming many lengthened cases I would not be without it.  I also pick up range brass in 5.56 and the cases most always exceed the maximum case length.  Processing hundreds of cases is an easy chore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "11644  Absolutely WORTH it!! I kind of balked a little at the price at first. I mean who spends 140.00 on a pillow even an organic one??  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this pillow and it is absolutely the best one I have ever owned. I hope it isn't like most pillows and.

      "14067  I would buy again but only in one color-not both Very sharp boot- ordered both black and brown when they were on sale for $80.  But still not sure I received such a great deal, and would prefer if they were a bit taller, and hit mid knee which is a more flattering height.  With all that said, they are extremely comfortable with a nice rubber sole that adds to that comfort.  The heel shape is great too-larger which adds to walking stability and creates a more casual look. I'll wear these for many years to come.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because I prefer if they were longer which is a more flattering look, and I would have preferred paying a lower price than the 79.95 final sale from Dillards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

I didn't expect to have to assemble a 600.00 sideboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
      "15520  Do not get this sectional!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We bought this sectional sofa four months ago. We also purchased the ottoman and the recliner with it and it is awful quality! It has ripped in several places. Not just the sofa but the ottoman and the recliner. Terrible product! It shouldn't even be sold! We spent $1200.00 on everything and if you make a purchase that big and especially it being furniture for your living room it should not tear up in four months! I wish I had my money back and I could get something else that is better quality! Very dissatisfied! DO NOT GET THIS!!! I had also ordered everything and when I got to the store they had sold my recliner to someone else so we ended up having to get the one on the floor which was the last one they had! My opinion we should be able to take it back and show them how bad it has torn apart and they should refund our money or let us pick anything else out that we want! I'm not even going to mention how many times we had to return to the store after we got home and parts were missing and the first one we bought we came home set everything up only to find that there was a RIP in the one we brought home from the store so we went back and they gave us a new one and four months later it's tearing up everywhere!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "16455  Not working less than 6 months time Using daily at least.  Had it since about Jan of this year.  I purchased at Dollar General in Bellville, TX.  It didn't work this morning at all, so I assumed I used up the batteries.  Changed same noting the correct position, and still does not come on, make a noise, nothing.  I am so angry.  Yes I only paid $7.50 but I could have bought a lot more batteries for that amount.  I really think I should at least be able to send in and get a new one, in exchange.  This is another typical reason why we should start paying attention to all the Chinese products.  And Dollar General would not exist if it had to use products made in USA or other acceptable countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "16749  A Bit Biased One star so it stands out.. please read! \\nSo Samsung wasn't my first choice nor was Brandsmart. Samsung because of their reputation in recent years and Brandsmart because of their extended warranty issues in the past and their vendors.. let's see fingers crossed. \\nHowever, Brandsmart had THE BEST price in town. Brandsmarts' deal was sooo good I couldn't pass the Samsung's. I really got a great deal. Paid $1199.99 for the set. PLUS warranty and a couple of other things (hoses, etc).\\nPros: They're spectacular thus far. This model is loaded with features. FYI the washer DOES have a drum light but only on the 5.0 cu ft not the 4.5 cu ft. Only had these units a couple of weeks so we'll see if they stand the test of time. \\nCons: 1) YOU HAVE TO BUY the WiFi Samsung - Universal Smart Home Adapter\\nModel:HD2018GH ($25 each) to enjoy the alert features and so on. You can ONLY control the units if you press a specific button on the machine each time which defeats the purpose since you're already there to press it yourself. You CAN however monitor the units regardless without pressing any buttons..which I have to say saves time because you exactly when your load is done..\\n2) Setting up the WiFi was a major pain in the BUTT! I'm lucky that I do IT and was able to figure it out. Basically, you separate your 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.. so no band-steering on your router if you want these to work. They ONLY connect to 2.4 GHz.. make sure your network has different names on those frequencies so you're able to connect them. \\n\\nNote: If the washer makes a lot of noise on the spin cycle try adjusting the little rubber legs. Height, etc. It was really loud here and I was able to adjust reducing the noise almost to nothing. \\n\\nI must say Brandsmart lowered their price on this set and getting the credit adjusted was a breeze. I'm very happy with them so far and this entire process.                                                                                                   \n",
      "16841  great grouping round for Kimber 84L I have 2 Kimber 84L rifles and this shoots cloverleaf groups out of both of them, easily 3/4\" groups out of several different boxes.  Plus, keep your brass because if you decide to load later it'll save you $1.50/shot for Nosler brass (yes, I know its not the exact same but Nosler customer support says its close).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "17625  The best  mid-sized range bag, would buy again. Very well made range bag. Everything about it is well made and heavy -duty. Just the right size for 3 or 4 handguns, plus everything else you need for a day of fun & games. The zippers are the best , handles and shoulder strap are comfortable and sturdy. This bag is built to last, well designed, and easy to carry. I paid  for this bag @ ZORO than it was priced at the local gun store.

      "17852  Runs too Small I'm a bit disappointed in my first time trying NB shoes ever. I found this shoe looking fit latest best shoes for overpronation. Loved this color so I went with it. My toes were scrunched right up in the front of the shoe. I don't have an abnormally long toe or anything like that. I usually wear size 10, but this shoe is more like 9.75. I'm unsure if going a half size up would keep my same foot alignment/support where I need for overpronation.  The toe region also oddly seems to be missing support? Feels like there's no material between my toes and the ground, maybe some people like that, I don't.

      "18566  I would only buy it again when on sale! The Stamina Cutbacks that I recently purchased are only going to be used for casual wear.  Previous Stamina Cutbacks that I have purchased at retail stores where comfortable and I need a sneaker that is a wide fit.  However, it seems that the insoles do not have sufficient arch support so that I need to purchase a orthopedic grade insole that gives such support which adds another $50.00 to be able to wear the sneaker in complete comfort.  Also, if used for jogging the sneaker's tread wears out too fast in the heal area while the rest of the Stamina Cutback sneaker is still like new.   I put duck tape on the heel when it starts to wear down the black tread flat and starts to show the underneath white portion to get a little more life out of the sneaker since the rest is still like new.  I like the style and fit but they do not last long for running or jogging and need more arch support even though they are categorized as an athletic sneaker.  I only purchase them when on sale as I need to also purchase a better insole and the tread does not last long when used for jogging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "18694  Undisclosed Previous year I had purchased a full set of tires that cost  &#40;GoodYear&#41;, I had nothing but flat ties and each time I had to get it patch. After complaining of tires purchased and salesperson said I needed new tires, I then informed him I had just purchased them last year and according to what he life of tires was 65k miles and I only had 25k miles. Sales representative told me that tires I purchased were defective and that he would give me credit for new ones. So, I proceeded to get new set of different brands of tires, giving the benefit of the doubt it was a defect.  This visit I went in for a flat tire, salesperson stated that my tires need to be replaced because they were at 4/32. Salesperson check miles when new tires were purchase back January 2019 and the life of tires purchased were 65k miles and compared to what miles I had was only 23k miles. How is this company/ tire name promising x miles and life of tires and they are not living up to it? He said they would give me credit to purchase new tire.

      "18952  I would NEVER buy these again! We are VERY dissatisfied with the new cushions.  We will never buy them again.  They were more expensive 50.00 each thinking they would be better.  They sink when you sit on them.

      "21216  For a woman who lips were dry as a desert When I turned 35 years old, my lips started to get very dry. I was getting desperate because the cracks I had were painful, my lip skin was falling apart, UGH! Horrible! It made me feel down and sad. My lips  looked so horrible like if they were part of a horror movie. I used everything! From cheap lip moisturizers to expensive ones (over $ 20.00). Then when getting my favorite toner from Mamonde, I saw they had this in the Grab and Go at my local Ulta Store. I love Mamonde and so I gave it a try... and O.M.G.!!!\\n\\nIt was amazing!!! At first I felt my lips a bit tingled but in less than three days my lips looked healthy, smooth and hydrated!!! I use this lip balm from morning to night. \\n\\nWhen I start my morning skin care routine I apply the balm at the end step of my hydration process (before applying makeup/lipstick), after I remove my makeup/cleansing skin care routine and before going to bed. It last a lot, the glossy effect is something I love too, you can put any lippie on top of it, or use any lipstick to give it a tint. Or just go with the natural gloss of it.\\n\\nI have used it for over 4 weeks and still have good amount of product. The price is right for the results I got, and will continue to use it. Thank you Mamonde for this wonderful lip balm!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "23246  Its thin. Its so thin its drapery. Not insulated at all. You want $54.99 full price, then $24.99 for discount then when I purchased it, it was on clearance for $15.94 & thank god for that bc its not worth  its so cheap feeling, thin and really isnt anything more than fashion wear since its NOT insulated. Walmart and Target have cheaper priced and better quality brands! Everyone save urself the trouble and money. The only mildly okay thing with this vest is its true to size, maybe with a little wiggle room as its considered 'outdoor wear'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "23257  Soft & cozy My daughter really liked that socks go up on the calf & stay up. Most \"slipper-type\" socks slide down & get bunched. Tho calf elastic could be a little tight for some girls over age 13 or 125 lbs.  I bought 8 pair of the socks in Christmas designs as small gift for nieces.

      "24167  What you expect I received a full size jar of Renergie Lift Multi-action Ultra Face Cream With SPF 30 to try for my honest review. I tried the cream for 2 weeks, applying in the morning and before bed. It really left my skin feeling silky smooth. I did not see much difference in tightening on my face, but did see an improvment on my neck...after losing 20lbs the skin was lose and looked tired. This really helped in that area. I liked the smell as well. The only down side is the price. If this was 50.00 or less I would buy it on a regular basis....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

PS GOOD quality...too bad they don't fit and they cost too much to return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "26322  Loved the price until I removed the plastic wrap I thought this was an awesome deal for $2.99 and had bought myself a a total of 5 of these frames in different colors.  I was going to buy one as a gift for a friend.  But when I removed the plastic wrap, I saw small indent or bubble imperfections in a couple of them.  I did not or could not see those imperfections through the plastic wrap or I would not have purchased them.  Luckily, of the ones I kept and am using, they sit on a shelf where people cannot get too close and hopefully will never notice the glass imperfections.  But I would have been embarrassed if one I gave as a gift had the same imperfection.  Overall, still a decent frame for a situation like mine and for the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
      "26422  It isn't worth the money! Before even getting this paid off, it is unraveling!! Very cheap materials and very cheaply made. I purchased it for my room,  the smaller rugs are used in the hall and the kitchen. I'm not sure about removing stains but as it is falling apart now, it will be trashed soon enough.Wearing high heels, playing games on it or having a pet in the home... forget these rugs! $134.00 total and 2 months old? What a waste of money 😭😭😭... Also, since it is made of cheap plastic polyester type material, DO NOT USE around open flames!

      "26876  Weekly Appointment Book Reorder #70-008, dimensions 3\"x6.25\".  For decades I have used this pocket calendar, with a black leather cover, address book insert and blank pad insert.  The store from which I bought inserts yearly lost its lease.  Office Depot has no refills and I cannot find anyone who sells them.  I should not have to buy a whole new product every year;  I just the insert(s)!

      "27522  Very nice saw, starts easy saws fast. One small problem We had a derecho (A line of intense, widespread, and fast-moving windstorms and sometimes thunderstorms that moves across a great distance and is characterized by damaging winds.) in eastern Iowa on 08/10/2020. Chain saws were hard to find. I found this at Ace Hardware. They had one left and delivered it to my truck curbside. Great people to do business with. We used it quite a bit at first but had to get a saw with 26\" bar. Unfortunately the chain adjuster on 16\" Craftsman is not like the older saws. It is a slotted head shaft with a gear at the end. That gear turns a geared head on what I would call the screw that turns the boss that tightens the bar. It would eventually strip both gears enough that you could not tighten the chain and bar. This \"Rube Goldberg\" design makes tightening the chain a chore. Instead of a straight screw and a boss to tighten the chain we have a 90 degree gear and pinion that get worn and sloppy. Said gear and pinion tightener is not sold separately. You have to replace the entire clutch assembly. I ordered one on 12/21/2020 from MTD Parts as MTD makes the saw for Craftsman ped to my door but the part is back ordered until the last week in January! Who thought and engineered  this foolish chain adjuster? Probably the same team who came up with \"New Coke Coca Cola.\" Now I gotta go refill my wind bag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

      "28487  Great for the price and cute print I got these on sale, so this review is based on paying $1.25 per mask. These are triple layer, which is what the CDC is recommended for cloth face masks now (December 2020), so that's nice. The fabric options are also great, and the adjustable ear loops are handy. I will say these are HUGE. They cover above the nose basically down to the neck, which is good for coverage, but kind of annoying on my face. I bought the kid size, too, and they still cover my nose and mouth just fine, so a size in between would be great. I have not washed yet, though, and other reviews say they shrink. I typically handwash masks, though. The addition of a metal nose piece would help immensely, but again, these were super cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "29274  Received incorrect items, no recourse from Shutterfly to cor I paid extra to purchase preaddressed envelopes to go with our Christmas cards this year. I received 60 envelopes that were preaddressed with someone else's name and address. When I contacted customer service I was informed that they would not replace the envelopes with corrected ones. The only recourse I was offered was a promo code for the purchase of preaddressed envelopes. You cannot purchase envelopes on their own through Shutterfly. They are only available as an add on to a card purchase. In addition, my promo code expires within the month so I can't even apply towards a future card purchase. So I paid roughly $100 for custom printed cards and envelopes that arrived incorrect and then I was informed that my only option was to buy a new set of cards with new envelopes and Shutterfly would cover the $17.40 cost for addressing those new envelopes, but not the $81 for the cards (which in reality would have been far higher because I used a now expired coupon code for 40% off). I will no longer be a Shutterfly customer after this experience. I have used this service for over 10 years for everything from Christmas cards to my wedding albums. My customer service experience this holiday season left me disappointed, angry, and having to scramble to find envelopes that matched in size and color somewhere else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "29947  Purchased 11/19, on sale for  now... So I purchased a few items on 11/19, and now these jeans are  than the price I paid. I chatted with someone at Duluth and was told since more than 7 days has passed and I already received them at a sales price back on 11/19, there was nothing they could do. Is it just me, or should they honor the lowered price three weeks later?

      "31177  I would not buy any product from Singer ever again. I ordered a Singer Patchwork Sewing and QUILTING Machine, you sent a regular Sewing Machine. Your ad has both items listed by side. You emailed the order confirmation at once. It took 3 days  and 2 emails from me to obtain delivery date and tracking number. The product arrived, but you sent the wrong item. I requested a shipping label from you, after 2 more requests without a word from you , I decided to return the product back to you and paid out of pocket  it back to you. The shipping label arrived too late! I got multiple excuses from you and always suggesting that the fault was on my behalf. Please refer to emails to confirm my statements. I have been reimbursed $199.99 , but the $30.70 is still unpaid. I believe that singer should pay this amount to me immediately. My experience dealing with Singer has been overwhelmingly painful and expensive, yes, $30.70 worth.  My pride and purse attest witness to that. In case you decide to pay me back my address is Myra Fresquez PO Box 1801 Guymon Oklahoma 73942                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
