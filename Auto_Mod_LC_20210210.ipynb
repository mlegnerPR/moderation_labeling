      "38079    I purchased both sizes of the \"realistic garland\" and they were the most fake pieces of decorations ever. The shorter one was too short for anywhere and the longer one was barely long enough for my mantle.

      "51335    When you read the description it says two live edge planks turned towards each other and filled with resin. You get the impression you are viewing a real table. Not the case. It is 3mm veneer on top of MDF composite wood. The resin is 3mm deep. If you look at the end you can see it is capped with veneer. Fake. Super disappointing when it says crafted out of wood. I guess I should have read the fine print. It is a nice looking fake table but if you want a real one, keep looking as I will.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

      "132505   This concealer looks nice on the face, other than it oxidized a tiny bit. When I first opened it I noticed my packaging is different? Maybe Ulta gave me a fake one idk, but the smell is so strong & it burned as soon as I put it on!! My face still burns after having it off for 24 hours so this is probably a nice concealer, but I'm assuming I got a fake one. If this isn't fake & all of her concealer is like this, then that's sad lol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
      "132855   I specifically went to Nautica thinking you would have high-quality belts.  The belt arrived and my husband said are you sure this is leather? I looked on the belt and it says the buckle part is leather the rest of the braided belt is imitation leather.  Nautica,  1/35th of an item does not qualify a label as leather.  Fix your description.  I would not have purchased it knowing it was fake leather that's going to fall apart quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "289226   All these other comments gotta be fake because this thing is completely useless.  The audio quality is literally no different from the built-in iPhone 11 mic (may actually be worse). I've tested to make sure it's working. The tripod is also pretty flawed as you can't set the phone up vertically on it--only horizontally. Sorry for sounding like a Karen but I paid $300 for something that has no use. Would return in a heartbeat if I could.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "379282   Jessie Decker is a well-known plagiarizer. 100% of these recipes are stolen from real celebrity cookbooks, then she throws them in a book for a quick money grab. Same with Kittenish. She claimed to be a clothes designer. But she is not. She buys wholesale from China, and replaces the manufacturers labels with her own fake Kittenish store label. She's a fake, she's a fraud, she's always looking to capitalize on her husband's name and money. Such a wannabe. That's why this book flopped.

Very disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "682424   Anyone voting this above 3 stars is either a child who just wants the brand name or never owned good headphones to compare these to. Quality is sub par, made of cheap plastic and fake leather they feel like a child's toy (probably why so many children gave this a 5*), one side of the headphones stopped working recently, that's how badly they're made. The audio quality isn't bad but there are considerably better options for the same price or less, Bose or sennheiser are two similarly priced options which are MUCH better than these overpriced Chinese toys. Save your money and buy something with great sound quality at this price, not these mediocre rip-offs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "840981   This is painted up to look like a mechanical toothbrush with moving parts, but all the parts are fixed in place. The top part vibrates slightly instead of rotating, and the bottom part is entirely non-moving despite the picture showing it moving. Terms like \"Dual Action\" and \"360 degrees\" and \"4x\" are placed to imply that it has functions beyond a standard toothbrush with a cheap vibrator put in it. This is the same as the Dollar Store fake vibrating toothbrush, just more of a scam and a price.\\nMy teeth are in pain during a pandemic where I can't see a dentist, and Colgate preys on customers with scams?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

      "968356   I have been a loyal Brighton customer for over a decade and it pains me to see them use Native American patterns in their Southwest lines when they are not designed by Native Americans. Brighton should be responsible and hire Native artists for these collections instead of having non-natives make these which results in cultural appropriation and stealing of culture.  You can find much nicer products from actual Native American artists which include real pieces of turquoise and not cheap reproductions of their patterns or fake turquoise stones glued together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

The real ones are more durable and I got these in a size 9 and they were to big but I when to a store that sells crocs I saw that those size 9a fit perfect yet these, the same size 9 where fitting like a 10 (the sizes I refer to are for women's) save your money and get real crocs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "1084274  This bar of soap (if you can call it that!) is so disappointing. Are you sure you didn't make this for hotel rooms?  I've been using Coast since the beginning and loved, loved, loved it until this 4 oz. Bar rolled out. You changed the scent and the size (again).  You should have named it something else because it is not COAST!  I stocked up on the real thing when I noticed a change happening in the stores. Now, I have only two 5oz. Bars remaining.

Luckily, my brother is an attorney, but he will be making sure they regret not refunding what is mine back to me. You have been warned. I went on and looked at their Instagram and they have 400k followers, but in deeper research, most of them are fake/spam accounts.

      "1316982  I will be returning this because it is advertised as a leather bag. It's actually a \"Eco-Leather\" which Fossil has no definition for other than the fact that its \"Leather\", but when I inquired it's made out of artificial material. Buyer BEWARE!

      "1320857  When you attempt to purchase this box spring He will be continually redirected by the site forcing you to accept their $150 delivery for a $50 box spring. I stopped in at two separate stores one in Milwaukee one in Illinois, both of them told me they do not stock these and are not allowed to stock these.  This is a typical bait and switch, attempting to dupe an unsuspected buyer into paying an exorbitant delivery fee after advertising hello price and a \"pick up in store\".

It honestly looked fake and I'm still questioning if the perfume is even the REAL juicy couture. The packaging looked like it was printed directly from a computer and wrapped onto a perfume box. The product was very cheap in appearance and it actually came in pieces that I had to put together after my fiancé opened the gift...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "38079    Awful I purchased both sizes of the \"realistic garland\" and they were the most fake pieces of decorations ever. The shorter one was too short for anywhere and the longer one was barely long enough for my mantle. I can't use it because it looks awful. the ends just flair out and the battery boxes are huge and awkward and are completely visible. It is too much of a hassle to return so now I am stuck wtih some extremely expensive decor boxes in my storage area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
      "51335    Veneer not real wood. When you read the description it says two live edge planks turned towards each other and filled with resin. You get the impression you are viewing a real table. Not the case. It is 3mm veneer on top of MDF composite wood. The resin is 3mm deep. If you look at the end you can see it is capped with veneer. Fake. Super disappointing when it says crafted out of wood. I guess I should have read the fine print. It is a nice looking fake table but if you want a real one, keep looking as I will.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "132505   Smells like spray paint & burns This concealer looks nice on the face, other than it oxidized a tiny bit. When I first opened it I noticed my packaging is different? Maybe Ulta gave me a fake one idk, but the smell is so strong & it burned as soon as I put it on!! My face still burns after having it off for 24 hours so this is probably a nice concealer, but I'm assuming I got a fake one. If this isn't fake & all of her concealer is like this, then that's sad lol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "132855   Description is a lie imitation leather I specifically went to Nautica thinking you would have high-quality belts.  The belt arrived and my husband said are you sure this is leather? I looked on the belt and it says the buckle part is leather the rest of the braided belt is imitation leather.  Nautica,  1/35th of an item does not qualify a label as leather.

      "289226   Completely Useless, No Different From iPhone Mic--Do Not Buy All these other comments gotta be fake because this thing is completely useless.  The audio quality is literally no different from the built-in iPhone 11 mic (may actually be worse). I've tested to make sure it's working. The tripod is also pretty flawed as you can't set the phone up vertically on it--only horizontally. Sorry for sounding like a Karen but I paid $300 for something that has no use. Would return in a heartbeat if I could.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Used the same info on a different piece of furniture that wasn't on sale and had no issue. It is an extremely sketchy company that simply lists items on sale to draw you in only to not sell the item at the listed price. I'm sure the piece would have been great, but they use fake billing info issues to limit they number of items they sell at the sale price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "379282   Yet another Jessica flop Jessie Decker is a well-known plagiarizer. 100% of these recipes are stolen from real celebrity cookbooks, then she throws them in a book for a quick money grab. Same with Kittenish. She claimed to be a clothes designer. But she is not. She buys wholesale from China, and replaces the manufacturers labels with her own fake Kittenish store label. She's a fake, she's a fraud, she's always looking to capitalize on her husband's name and money. Such a wannabe. That's why this book flopped.

Very disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "682424   The 5 star reviews are clearly children Anyone voting this above 3 stars is either a child who just wants the brand name or never owned good headphones to compare these to. Quality is sub par, made of cheap plastic and fake leather they feel like a child's toy (probably why so many children gave this a 5*), one side of the headphones stopped working recently, that's how badly they're made. The audio quality isn't bad but there are considerably better options for the same price or less, Bose or sennheiser are two similarly priced options which are MUCH better than these overpriced Chinese toys. Save your money and buy something with great sound quality at this price, not these mediocre rip-offs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

      "840981   Literally a lying scam This is painted up to look like a mechanical toothbrush with moving parts, but all the parts are fixed in place. The top part vibrates slightly instead of rotating, and the bottom part is entirely non-moving despite the picture showing it moving. Terms like \"Dual Action\" and \"360 degrees\" and \"4x\" are placed to imply that it has functions beyond a standard toothbrush with a cheap vibrator put in it. This is the same as the Dollar Store fake vibrating toothbrush, just more of a scam and a price.\\nMy teeth are in pain during a pandemic where I can't see a dentist, and Colgate preys on customers with scams?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Very disappointed that the watch seems to be a fake that was sent by the company to us. Would love to give a higher rating as he is happy with it other than the band being too large which is fixable, but if you can't back up the products you distribute then I shouldn't have given even 2 stars.

      "968356   Cultural appropriation I have been a loyal Brighton customer for over a decade and it pains me to see them use Native American patterns in their Southwest lines when they are not designed by Native Americans. Brighton should be responsible and hire Native artists for these collections instead of having non-natives make these which results in cultural appropriation and stealing of culture.  You can find much nicer products from actual Native American artists which include real pieces of turquoise and not cheap reproductions of their patterns or fake turquoise stones glued together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

The real ones are more durable and I got these in a size 9 and they were to big but I when to a store that sells crocs I saw that those size 9a fit perfect yet these, the same size 9 where fitting like a 10 (the sizes I refer to are for women's) save your money and get real crocs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "1084274  Fake Coast This bar of soap (if you can call it that!) is so disappointing. Are you sure you didn't make this for hotel rooms?  I've been using Coast since the beginning and loved, loved, loved it until this 4 oz. Bar rolled out. You changed the scent and the size (again).  You should have named it something else because it is not COAST!  I stocked up on the real thing when I noticed a change happening in the stores. Now, I have only two 5oz. Bars remaining.

      "1181989  Fake  watered down Can i get my money back? This Versace Dreamer is fake. This is the 2nd time i purchased and it's still the same. The first one was the tester, i thought since it's a tester that's why is so weak. The 2nd time i bought is with a box to make sure i got the legit one, but it's still the same. I know how the legit one looks like. It supposed to last longer than 5mins with only 1 spray and the smell of powdery taboco it should be there.

This is a fake ad When you attempt to purchase this box spring He will be continually redirected by the site forcing you to accept their $150 delivery for a $50 box spring. I stopped in at two separate stores one in Milwaukee one in Illinois, both of them told me they do not stock these and are not allowed to stock these.  This is a typical bait and switch, attempting to dupe an unsuspected buyer into paying an exorbitant delivery fee after advertising hello price and a \"pick up in store\".

The shorter one was too short for anywhere and the longer one was barely long enough for my mantle. I can't use it because it looks awful. the ends just flair out and the battery boxes are huge and awkward and are completely visible. It is too much of a hassle to return so now I am stuck wtih some extremely expensive decor boxes in my storage area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
      "51335    Veneer not real wood. When you read the description it says two live edge planks turned towards each other and filled with resin. You get the impression you are viewing a real table. Not the case. It is 3mm veneer on top of MDF composite wood. The resin is 3mm deep. If you look at the end you can see it is capped with veneer. Fake. Super disappointing when it says crafted out of wood. I guess I should have read the fine print. It is a nice looking fake table but if you want a real one, keep looking as I will.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

I looked on the belt and it says the buckle part is leather the rest of the braided belt is imitation leather.  Nautica,  1/35th of an item does not qualify a label as leather.

I would not have purchased it knowing it was fake leather that's going to fall apart quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "379282   Yet another Jessica flop Jessie Decker is a well-known plagiarizer. 100% of these recipes are stolen from real celebrity cookbooks, then she throws them in a book for a quick money grab. Same with Kittenish. She claimed to be a clothes designer. But she is not. She buys wholesale from China, and replaces the manufacturers labels with her own fake Kittenish store label. She's a fake, she's a fraud, she's always looking to capitalize on her husband's name and money. Such a wannabe. That's why this book flopped.

      "404169   I will not buy this item again This is a fake company and they do not fix anything. They have a fake website and do not answer the phone. I basically gave them free money to fix nothing and I will be reporting to the credit bureau. If I do not make a payment on time they will report to the credit bureau. So I will do the same thing. I never had a miss payment or an on time payment.

Now, all communication has stopped and they have ignored all my messages. Please, beware. I now have to get my attorney involved for a $350 order. Luckily, my brother is an attorney, but he will be making sure they regret not refunding what is mine back to me. You have been warned. I went on and looked at their Instagram and they have 400k followers, but in deeper research, most of them are fake/spam accounts.

      "682424   The 5 star reviews are clearly children Anyone voting this above 3 stars is either a child who just wants the brand name or never owned good headphones to compare these to. Quality is sub par, made of cheap plastic and fake leather they feel like a child's toy (probably why so many children gave this a 5*), one side of the headphones stopped working recently, that's how badly they're made. The audio quality isn't bad but there are considerably better options for the same price or less, Bose or sennheiser are two similarly priced options which are MUCH better than these overpriced Chinese toys. Save your money and buy something with great sound quality at this price, not these mediocre rip-offs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

      "840981   Literally a lying scam This is painted up to look like a mechanical toothbrush with moving parts, but all the parts are fixed in place. The top part vibrates slightly instead of rotating, and the bottom part is entirely non-moving despite the picture showing it moving. Terms like \"Dual Action\" and \"360 degrees\" and \"4x\" are placed to imply that it has functions beyond a standard toothbrush with a cheap vibrator put in it. This is the same as the Dollar Store fake vibrating toothbrush, just more of a scam and a price.\\nMy teeth are in pain during a pandemic where I can't see a dentist, and Colgate preys on customers with scams?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Very disappointed that the watch seems to be a fake that was sent by the company to us. Would love to give a higher rating as he is happy with it other than the band being too large which is fixable, but if you can't back up the products you distribute then I shouldn't have given even 2 stars.

      "968356   Cultural appropriation I have been a loyal Brighton customer for over a decade and it pains me to see them use Native American patterns in their Southwest lines when they are not designed by Native Americans. Brighton should be responsible and hire Native artists for these collections instead of having non-natives make these which results in cultural appropriation and stealing of culture.  You can find much nicer products from actual Native American artists which include real pieces of turquoise and not cheap reproductions of their patterns or fake turquoise stones glued together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

The real ones are more durable and I got these in a size 9 and they were to big but I when to a store that sells crocs I saw that those size 9a fit perfect yet these, the same size 9 where fitting like a 10 (the sizes I refer to are for women's) save your money and get real crocs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "1084274  Fake Coast This bar of soap (if you can call it that!) is so disappointing. Are you sure you didn't make this for hotel rooms?  I've been using Coast since the beginning and loved, loved, loved it until this 4 oz. Bar rolled out. You changed the scent and the size (again).  You should have named it something else because it is not COAST!  I stocked up on the real thing when I noticed a change happening in the stores. Now, I have only two 5oz. Bars remaining.

      "1181989  Fake  watered down Can i get my money back? This Versace Dreamer is fake. This is the 2nd time i purchased and it's still the same. The first one was the tester, i thought since it's a tester that's why is so weak. The 2nd time i bought is with a box to make sure i got the legit one, but it's still the same. I know how the legit one looks like. It supposed to last longer than 5mins with only 1 spray and the smell of powdery taboco it should be there.

This is a fake ad When you attempt to purchase this box spring He will be continually redirected by the site forcing you to accept their $150 delivery for a $50 box spring. I stopped in at two separate stores one in Milwaukee one in Illinois, both of them told me they do not stock these and are not allowed to stock these.  This is a typical bait and switch, attempting to dupe an unsuspected buyer into paying an exorbitant delivery fee after advertising hello price and a \"pick up in store\".

      "3113    This mascara was terrible!  Halfway through my day I had raccoon eyes!

      "4547    I bought these grips about a month ago and initially really liked their feel. Really soft rubber, very grippy, and comfortable. Not too much texture or stuff in the way, and they fit my hands well. It even reduced hand fatigue in comparison to specialized trail grips.\\n\\nHowever after about a month of riding, a few times a week, they're already showing signs of ware on the grip pattern. Additionally the grip ends aren't very durable at all. They ripped off the first time I laid my bike down on a turn.\\n\\nI think these would be good for riders looking for a high level of comfort, aren't too rough on their bikes, or don't mind replacing grips often. If you take a lot of risks on the trail or are new to the sport I would look for something more durable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "13613   I am so disappointed. This is a replace one, my original one is very loosed, cannot hold the power, but this new, replaced one is the same. I am checked, it is too shallow when plug in, so is very loosed, I have to use something to have it hold in plug in/connection position but still very easy yo lost connection/cord. Since this is the new one but shows the same problem as the original one, my conclusion is that the pot's power slot is not fit with the power cord!!!!!!!! This is a simple thing, but IP did show the design defect. I like the pop, but cannot believe that there is such a simple, but design defect! If other types pops are the same, I am a fraud that I will not buy again - a lot of hassles, sometime during cook, it lost connection, lost the power, even I use something to hold the cord in the place. I use all kind appliances which using electrical and have the power cords, I never even encounter the loosed power cord that cannot hold the connection. I think your tach/design department should take the problem seriously, and solve the problem in the future product, otherwise you will lost the customers. I hate to say so because I like the pop in general, but this is a basic condition - if all functions of the product are excellent, but no power, just would not work.  BTW, I like the IP's services, so I hope it cannot improved and earn my trust again.\\nMindy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
      "14775   The very first night I received the pillow an armed intruder burst into my bedroom. He pointed a .357 magnum at me and out of share instinct I put the pillow in front of me. I heard 3 gun shots ring out, but to my surprise, not a single 1 penetrated the pillow. This also stunned the burglar and in his moment of bewilderment I swung the pillow at him as hard as I could. It hit him square on his left side and sent him crashing face first into my dresser. Blood spilled from his clearly broken nose as I loaded up for my ensuing  back swing. I don't have the best accuracy swinging this way and caught him on his left knee causing it to buckle backwards in a horrific 90 degree angle. The burglar dropped to floor and the gun toppled from his hand. As he scrambled to regain control of the revolver I hoisted the pillow over my head (this thing weighs more than most sledge hammers) and brought it down squarely on his back, snapping his spinal column. \\n     I had to pay cleaners $500 to get all the blood stains out of the carpet, I was arrested for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and I'm being sued by the burglar for his medical expenses and trauma, but this pillow is so comfortable I sleep as if I don't have a care in the world. \\n4 out 5 stars because it weighs NINE POUNDS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
      "14835   In an effort to practice social distancing I set up zelle to transfer money from my Chase account to another outside bank account. I made several attempts to get it working because both banks had the same phone and email info. As a result my online access was locked and I received an email to call customer service. Once I called and explained my situation I went through a series of verifications to establish my legitimacy and access was granted and my transaction completed. With all of the fraudulent activity going on I am so grateful for the stringent guidelines Chase took to lock my account and verify that I am the account owner before granting me access again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "15612   I am posting this is in response to Erad's unwarranted review. I have ordered 10,000+ factory 2nds and blemished bullets, various calibers, and have always been ecstatic with the value that Midwayusa offers them at. With all the multiple orders I have made on factory 2nds I have came across multiple bullets that I would consider \"out of spec\" even had some packaged with different weights; 143gr eld and 147 eld's for example. That being said, if you ALWAYS follow safe reloading practices, you'll stay safe. Use factory published load data for the exact components being loaded, start at the beginning load charge for powder, etc. When finding a bullet that is 0.001\" over-spec (ie 0.265\" vs 0.264\") implementing these reloading \"Golden Rules\" will ensure you stay safe.  Erad's review is unwarranted because he is way off base accusing Midwayusa of fraud and must be a \"newb\" to reloading if he thinks 0.001\" will cause severe over-pressuer. That is why ANY reloading manual states over and over again to always use a starting load when developing a SAFE load. If Erad was to do that he would learn that the bullets he purchased would work and probably work well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "18626   A young lawyer's story of social justice and finding her place in the world.\\nYolanda Vance is a young African American recently graduated lawyer. Yolanda has had to single-mindedly strive and achieve to survive in a world that has left her essentially orphaned.  In her first job as an attorney at a prestigious corporate New York law firm, she is asked to shred documents in the middle of a raid by the FBI. The firm is guilty of securities fraud and Yolanda does the right thing and becomes a whistleblower. She is offered a position with the FBI, which she thinks will be a desk job. To her surprise, Yolanda is sent undercover to infiltrate an eco- and social justice activist group in California, who are taking on a large energy corporation with a defense contract. The activist group is seen as a threat by the FBI, but Yolanda quickly realizes that all is not that it seems and begins to question who the real criminals are.  Yolanda starts as a narrow, focused and, in some ways, naive character who grows and empowers herself throughout the story. A Spy in the Struggle explores a lot of interesting and relevant issues such as how racial, community, environmental and social justice all intersect. Like Yolanda, we, as readers, are led to contemplate and question what we see in our world and investigate what is occurring beneath the surface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

      "20529   I absolutely LOVE this fragrance!  I have been wearing this scent every sense I found it in Dallas, TX in 1995 on a business trip!  This is my \"signature\" fragrance & I am sorely disappointed that the price has went through the roof!  I know that they discontinued it, but, do you have to price gouge with the remaining stock!  Just awful!  I won't buy it again until the price is reasonable like the rest of the fragrances.  DARN Shame!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "21765   What I purchased is a good product.  The sales staff is deceptive and push you through the process and tell you they cannot do things that they clearly can such as not make you sign up for the optional insurance.  After you get sucked in to getting the insurance you then have to jump through hoops to get the insurance removed.  Customer service is no help as they direct you back to the store.  The store is little help as they don't know what to do and just give you a form to fill out instead of not making you sign up for the insurance to begin with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
      "23801   Frustrating. Wasted a lot  of time trying to use a coupon code and gift certificate at the same time. I got a notification that I would have to call because I tried to enter a code too many times, like I was doing something deceitful.  I was going to buy even more but decided your company does not appreciate paying customers. If I didn't have a gift certificate to use I would have canceled the full order. Will tell friends and family to avoid gifting from your company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "27526   I am so glad to have discovered Duluth for plus size women! The clothes are comfortable, hearty, and fit incredibly well! \\n\\nMy visits to the stores have always been pleasant until my most recent. I bought a shirt for my Dad and needed to return due to size. I didn't have my receipt, but the shirt still had tags and the adhesive strip. The associate stated he needed to 'look it up,' trying to find when the item was sold. After several minutes of perusing, he stated he found the item and he was refunding me $9.95. I paid $22.50 for this shirt, so he said he would keep looking. A manager finally came over and asked the associate to return the item. It was a very frustrating experience. I don't like to be made to feel as though I'm lying or trying to cheat the system. Still love and recommend Duluth, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

      "38605   I love the looks and storage of French Door refrigerators, just not happy with the ice maker. The design is flawed by trying to put the ice maker in thr warmer storage area instead of in the freezer portion. The Ice maker freezes up tight. I contact service that comes out, thaws out the ice maker giving me ice for about three months before freezing up again.\\nI have an extended warranty, but they are frustrated. I called Samsung and have had two service technicians attempt to fix it by replacing new parts. First such repair froze up again in 3 months.\\nI am tired of buying ice, and Samsung is silent after filing a BBB complaint. I am considering replacing the unit with another brand or a side-by-side with the ice maker in the freezer side.\\nBottom line: not happy with Samsung support of their product.

      "40519   I purchased this based off of the amazing reviews and now I feel cheated. Not only does this product not smell good, but it does NOTHING to moisturize hair! I purchased it with the matching shampoo, which overly dried out my hair. I thought maybe the conditioner would make up for it, but nope! The shampoo needs only a very small amount to lather but the conditioner requires HEAPS of it to add even the tiniest bit of moisture back to your hair. I would say the ratio of conditioner to shampoo is 20:1, so it's not exactly cost effective. It smells like drugstore baby shampoo to me, not honey or anything good. The scent was very off putting. The conditioner has ZERO slip and not even handfuls of it will add any slip to it. It almost feels like once you put it on your hair it just disappears. My hair was not soft, moisturized, nor did it smell pleasant after using this. I'm so confused how the ratings on this are so high. If you have dry or curly/wavy hair, stay away from this.

      "45922   This is my first and last time trying this product line. It does not have 10 speeds and it is barely working. I'm so disappointed, I had just made this in store purchase yesterday because they had this specific item its great and most popular item.  I was looking forward to the 10 speeds but it only has one and for something that has the word power in the title of the name it sure has none it is definitely barely working I would not recommend this item to anyone and will not be be purchasing any of this particular brand of products ever again.

      "47068   I ordered a pallet and a lipgloss. The lipgloss is the only thing I received. I made contact with customer care. It has been 3 weeks and they keep asking me questions as if I am a liar or a theif.

      "47114   Description states that this is the actual machine to trim nails, however, when I first received it was only a pack of 6 replacement rollers. Called customer service and was told that the correct product would be shipped out. Received the replacement and that too was just the pack of 6 replacement rollers. Never received the actual trimming machine as the description states. I was also charged for the replacement shipment when I was told there would be no charge as I did not receive what was advertised in the description the first time. DO NOT BUY!! You will NOT get what is in the description!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "64845   The Ruger American Rifle is genius in its simplicity and effectiveness.  It is strong, easy to work, and accurate.  The bedding system is solid and well designed.  I own a few of these rifles.  If there was a fly in the ointment, it is its trigger.  It is the typical Glock style trigger marketed to us by Savage, Mossberg, and Ruger to name a few.  All touting how incredible it is.  It's really to keep them south of a lawsuit, and to many who grew up using good triggers from Winchester, Remington, and others, it stinks.  But marketers are good at telling us how red our blue shirt is and getting us to believe it.  So, I replaced mine with a Timney trigger.  And it is sweet sweet.  No take up, just a couple pounds of short pull and it breaks like a trigger should.  I have an old M70 Winchester with a nice \"smithed\" trigger that is perfection.  This Timney trigger comes so close to that right out of the box, that instead of paying smith fees in the future, I'll just install a new Timney.  It is easy to install and, if you know what a real good trigger should feel and perform like, then this is for you.  It makes a very good serviceable rifle into a great rifle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
      "68293   I absolutely love this!  I bought this for my home office which is an addition to the house and although I have a pellet stove which heats the rest of the house, this room never warmed enough for me.  Now I turn it on and it is so comfy that I want to go sit and do my work!  It is realistic and heats up with the click of the controller.  I was able to put the legs together with a simple screwdriver in 5 minutes!  Shown it to all my family members and everyone says the same thing - looks nice in the office and doesn't look cheap or phony.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "69106   New packaging has both ends closed which makes it impossible to reverse side with out ripping off one end.  Additional, gives less room for cat to scratch.  I've been using this brand for years but may reconsider because of the new packaging where you have to rip off part of it to even use it and ripping is very difficult and tedious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "72444   this product reminds me of the mac skin like foundation that you rub together to warm with your fingers and press in your skin.  it has the same dewy finish that enhances your skin from within.  it's not buildable it's sheer.  I do enjoy on some occasions but it's not for you if you are a full glam type of enthusiasts.  its also a brand owned by estee lauder.  I take issues with estee lauder around marketing strategies and ethics but that's a personal decision.  as far as the foundation goes.  its a lovely formula if you are just wanting a daytime and out for a few hours type of foundation.  applying it quick style is sometimes pleasing.  but if you love the process of applying foundation then it's not a fun one. \\n..for reference.....\\nI have dry to combo skin. my shade range is fair/neutral with slightly warm dominance. my concerns are large pores on nose, minimal aging signs like a few fine lines and scarring but I am 38 with a conscience of skin health and a skin care routine that is realistic based on scientific reasoning.....not beauty industry deceptive marketing hypes. I have  sun damage from my skin health ignorance years where I didn't understand the efficacy of caring for my skin.  fyi....everyone with anti aging on the mind should use spf all year around including on the eyes.  no fancy anti aging or eye cream can fight off sun damage like spf topical formulas.  but spf in foundations is unnecessary to hike the prices and isn't adequate enough to protect.  and I am platinum blonde and blue eyes. my family is very diverse and I have very dark black skinned beauty enthusiasts within my circle and very pale white skin family too. so my recommendation is with all that in mind to recommend and purchase foundations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

When the book surprised me on my doorstep this summer and I opened the box my first thoughts were, \"yep this sounds about right.\"  In the middle of the Covid-19 2020 fest of one new stress-causing event after another, a book about survival is indeed a captivating read.  I received this book from Harrison House, @HarrisonHousePublishers as part of the launch team for an honest review.\\n\\nI have a feeling that many now feel that these are the end times, especially with a worldwide pandemic affecting every part of our lives, from how we work, dress, socialize, and even attend worship services.

      "76594   This came out much darker and much more green than the pictures led me to believe. It comes out as a very dark teal. I probably would have known better if I could have bought it in person but as it was during the Pandemic and I was quarantining at home (but also wishing for new Nail colors to play with) I did not see it in person and the online photos are VERY deceptive. Not as glittery as I was hoping for either. Given the price point I hope that it lasts longer than my $10 nail polish brands but I have not had a chance to see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
      "79564   This safe is excellent, overall.  Well built, inside is so nice to protect whatever you put in it, great features and looks good.  My wife is even pleased with the appearance.\\nCouple of things I want to pass on from my experience setting it up...\\n1) It's heavy so get help moving and placing.\\n2) The serial number is on the back of the safe.  IT'S ALSO ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PACKING BOX!  If you have trouble someday getting into your safe, the serial number will allow Heritage Safe to help you back in, via codes or keys.  If someone checking trash removes the serial number from your disposed of box, they might be able to use it to scam codes or keys and get into your safe when your not home.  So, remove the serial number from the outside carton before disposal.\\n3) The 9V battery provided with the safe is poor quality.  Don't even bother to use it.  Put in a high quality 9V with a long shelf life and save yourself a headache later.\\nThat's about it.

      "94490   I got this shawl in 'malachite', which the picture shows as a nice dark grey. When i received it, it's actually a dark green. I would absolute return this for the false advertising of the color, but I don't have a UPS drop off near me and within quarantine, can't really drive out or go to places easily.

      "95366   Unlike many vegetarian 'bites' these aren't pappy but have a good firm texture and a good flavour too. They would have earned an extra star if it was not for the amount of fresh air in the box. The contents would have easily fitted into a box half the size. One can't help but feel ripped off when you open it. I don't really have space in my freezer for boxes of air plus I hate the waste involved in the extra packaging to surround it. (when will manufacturers wake up to the surplus packaging issue?) The only other,thing I can say is that it is quite pricey for the amount that you get in the box.

Now when I use it, I have to use vet wrap or tape which is annoying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "101409  The main side pocket is hardly usable when the main compartment is full.. The mesh pocket in the middle back of the pack doesn't stretch hardly at all compared to my Escapist pack, but I do like the stronger fabric on top of the stretch pocket to keep it from tearing.. Not sure why the company didn't put a huge Osprey logo on the center of the pack, as it would look way cooler if they did.\\n\\nMY BIGGEST GRIPE is with the water bottle holders.. They don't stretch near enough for bottles, especially when the pack is full. I have to force a Nalgene bottle into them with the pack off of me - I feel like they're going to rip off the pack and they have almost no stretch to them. The Atmos appears to have larger water bottle pockets and holes, as well as a larger loop to pull on for side loading of the water bottles. It's IMPOSSIBLE for me to use the side loads for water bottles on this pack; I could force a bottle into one with the pack off, but it would be jabbing me in the ribs/side the whole time, and the bottle angles down rather than up to fit in the pocket...\\n\\nThese few things need fixed to make this pack a true 5 Stars and to make me actually happy about it.\\n\\nOther than that, I love the side zipper to get into different depth of the main pack compartment. I also love that it comes with a rain fly - Atmos needs that in the USA version. The bottom compartment for a sleeping bag/bottom pack access is great too. I'd suggest slightly larger hip pockets too.. Something more like belly bag size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Class act all the way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
      "108964  I was so excited to order this bra. My first brand new ck (I only owned thrifted previously) I thought the brand was a mark of quality. I was wrong. I ordered the largest size available at the time thinking they cared about size inclusivity and body positivity. Also wrong. \\nThe bra fit relatively comfortable yet a bit tight. Then after my first wash/air dry and second wear it completely fell apart at the seam of the band. I felt so cheated out of my hard earned. \\nI'm planning to take my business to a more inclusive brand like TomboyX. To get a product I can hopefully count on. \\nI hope the future of Calvin Klein corrects itself on where it's products are produced, along with the quality of them. Also that they will expand their size range and ideas on how to cater to Various body types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "120766  When you search for ls timing chain advance pays to be top ad that pops up. Says in the headline true-roller. Yet the first question is why isn't it street legal and a verified reply was 1.not for factory roller i.e. the entire ls family. 2. Declares it's not a true roller.  Done shopping at advanced for me. Lying and deceitful is too much to win a sale I'll stick with cheaper more knowledgeable and ethicaly bound auto retailers  see if they block the truth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
      "127592  20yr 10mm veteran. I shot it all. 155gr jhp underwood is my do it all round. Self defense, deer, bear defense. NOTHING ELSE comes close when it comes to power and accuracy. I shoot alot of cheap s&b 10mm for proficiency and fun but love to shoot these 155gr underwood fmj rounds here and there because they are cheaper than the jhp ammo and match ballistics and point of aim for le$$. Also it's insanely fast and powerful out of my thureon defense carbine with 2\" groups at 100 yds. In my ruger match champion revolver and and my g40 (oem barrel and 7.25\" KKM barrel) i can make 5 holes touch at 25 yds if shooting off a sandbag. Superb stuff.

      "130034  First, I'd like to say, CTD did a little price gouge on me when I bought these at the beginning of COVID-19. I bought these after adding them to my cart, a week later the price fell to its now normal price. I bought 3, one for myself and 2 as gifts. I tested all 3 before gifting them away. All 3 fed and fired. But I'll be honest I don't like the looks of the quality of the spring. I don't know how it will do under extended load, not just loading it and firing it all the next day. Great for the range, but obviously impractical For a carry item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "130897  Purchased this when hand sanitizer became extinct in stores, and SO glad I did.  This is an excellent product.  I love that it's a liquid spray, not a gel.  It dries quickly.  It does not leave a residue or dry out your hands like other sanitizers.   I use this for sanitizing not just my hands, but all kinds of surfaces.  OK, yes... the odor is not exactly pleasant.  If you read some of the Amazon reviews some people say it smells like rotting flesh, poop, vomit, etc.   Those people are just being ridiculous.  The only thing it smells like is ethyl alcohol, which is exactly what it is.  Yes, it's strong, but as soon as it dries the smell is gone.   Not only do I like the product, but I appreciate the fact that Chemical Guys is manufacturing a product that we all need right now and they are selling it at a very reasonable price instead of trying to price gouge like so many others.  I recommend this to others and will continue to buy.  Would like if they produced scented versions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

      "138395  I ordered an in stock washer/dryer pair on 9/2/20. I should have seen red flags when other retailers said they couldn't fulfill the order for the same pair until 10/18/20. I placed the online order with Conn's, but my debit card transaction locked up the site. A phone call to support essentially said that I wasn't able to make the online order. After hanging up, I selected PayPal, and the transaction went through without issue. I again called customer service, as I wasn't able to select the delivery date for my order. Another red flag? I let the rep know that I was moving into a new house on 10/1/2020, and wanted delivery on that date. I was assured it would not be a problem and a note would be made. Less than a week later, I received an email telling me that the appliances would not be delivered until 10/18/20. I accepted, and called Conn's on 10/16/20 to confirm delivery would be on time and without issue. I was assured they would be.\\nOn 10/18/20, I got an email staying delivery would not be occurring that day. The next available date for delivery was 11/28/20. I contacted customer support to say this was unacceptable. After being transferred through several departments to ask when items would be in stock, I contacted the online orders department again. I was told that one of the two items was not in stock, but the same item in a different color was available. I was told that if I canceled and placed a new order, I could get it for the original sale price paid and within a few days. After placing the online order while the rep stayed on the phone, we found that the new items were not, in fact, in stock. With no other solution, my order had to be canceled for good. Overall, the online orders support was fantastic, but all other aspects of Conn's were very disappointing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "147401  First cuticle balm I've used. Before using this, my cuticles were incredibly dry with many hangnails around it. It does a good job of moisturizing, but the shape is weird. Like a jumbo lipstick. \\n\\nI apply it directly to my cuticles and rub it in with my fingers. Been using it for a few weeks now and I have noticed a difference. I no longer get cracks and dryness around my fingers. Also, I feel like it helped get rid of my hangnails. \\n\\nI recommend applying it at night as it's quite greasy. One point off for powdery old lady smell (I hate unnecessary fragrance in skin products) and another point off for deceptive packaging. The actual product took up about 1/4 of the tube. \\n\\nStill on the hunt for a good cuticle balm, but this one isn't bad for a first time user. Been trying to take better care of my hands. Handwashing is vital especially since Covid hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
      "150064  Love French's Yellow Mustard and have been using it for years. However, for the first time today, I needed 3/4 of a cup for a recipe. I opened a brand new 8oz bottle and guess what?

      "150623  Buyers be aware! Oldnavy shipped this item via UPS and while they marked the package as delivered, I never received it. I reported the issue in a timely manner to oldnavy but they make you wait 8 business days before anything can be done. At this point, the size I needed is out of stock. Very frustrating!!!  So be aware that you too could be a victim of their shipping scam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "155920  The product is fine.  Absolutely fine and there is not difference between buying this product from two different sources.  However, I bought this product to try to support my local business and all I wished to do was do it with no contact, however I was forced to have contact with the person to sign for something like $11 worth of material.  I have not had to do that in the past.  I was told that it was because there was credit card theft going on, to which I can only say that a decent thief would probably do better than 4 electrical boxes for their big heist.  All that said, I won't be coming back until after the pandemic.  I'll go find my stuff on amazon or ebay.  It appears that it's safer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "156589  I registered for this bassinet based on stellar reviews on this website as well as target and amazon and received it as a gift. Nowhere in any of the product details does it include the fact that this is not safe for unsupervised sleeping. I was looking through the Q&A on targets website to determine whether I could buy sheets for this product and came across answers directly from the company that this is not recommended for unsupervised or overnight sleeping. The advertising feels deceptive as it is marketed as being designed for sleep. I tried to write this review on target as well and they did not publish it so I think the positive reviews are likely inflated. Buyer beware.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

      "160295  This item had a hard start for me, I ordered during the COVID issue but wanted to support a friend didn't even think the wait would be extended so long.  Then upon getting the popper, I was pretty sure I got the wrong item, but it ships collapsed!  Looks very small in the HUGE box it was shipped in, but alls well.  Also I found the reason for the wait.  Made in China (not Vietnam - like on site) so I'm sure the delay was in manufacturing and customs (not at US packaging facility like implied on website).   \\nThings got better from there,  on my first pop, I used Orvile Reddenbackers (our standby for consistent popping corn) and no oil/butter  It did a good job!  not too many old maids (shhh) it did exactly what was expected.  The lid did not pop off (saw in other reviews), bowl was VERY hot (so don't plan on using as serving bowl as website shows unless you plan on waiting a while).\\nOverall, getting past the wait & made in China (wish Pampered Chef would buy local), the popper did what it was supposed to do. but giving 3 stars for what I felt was a little deceptive marketing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "161978  We ordered this product 21 days ago! Nearly a month ago! This was supposed to take 7 to 10 days to receive and we've never received the product. I have not received a refund and I have requested both. I called multiple times and only got through customer service once, after waiting for over an hour! At 1 hour and 18 minutes the lady that finally answered the call (who sounded nice and helpful) disconnected the call. So I got hung up on after an hour and 18 minutes, without her being able to help me at all. I messaged through the BJ's web site that day (a Thursday) and had to wait until the following week to hear back for their 2-3 business day wait period. Apparently it has been re-shipped again through their \"vendor\" but I only received a random tracking number without a way to track it. I have no idea what carrier this was sent through and therefore I have requested a link only to not hear back about that. Do not waste your time/money ordering this mattress!! I had planned on ordering another one but I will not as I am sure I will struggle to even get this mattress or a refund. I suppose we may have to go through our bank to dispute these charges as fraudulent. This has taken so much of my time it is absolutely ridiculous!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
      "162512  They looked like great bindings but were advertised as 3D compatible, so I paid for expedited shipping to get them sooner.  Not only were they NOT 3D compatible, EVO did not refund the expedited shipping when I returned them, even though I would never ever have ordered them had I known they wouldn't fit my old school Burton board.  It's false advertising and poor customer service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "169602  Everything was very good, but I was disappointed that the $15 marketing research credit (code DANKEAV1U19B) promised by Julie Genova was not acceptable. Since only 1 promo code is usable at a time, these $15 credits probably rarely get used, except for very small orders, where other promo codes would not apply.

      "171878  Great breakfast, so tasty when you want something warm. The egg takes more time to heat up, for some reason. I need to heat that seperalety. But I am used to that now and love this item. I add either hot sauce or ketchup or salsa, depending on what kind of mood I woke up in and it never fails-unless you leave it in the microwave too long or not enough, that is.

      "173149  I bought these on a whim because I love pacifica products (usually.. not universally, though).  I bought this one with the moisturizing one as well, both in travel size to test them.  I kind of had them in mind for my \"cheat\" days when I don't feel like doing my full skincare routine but I don't want to go to bed having done nothing.  I'll start with what I don't like.  The smell is so overpowering and sweet.  The fragrance is like an orange creamsicle, which maybe you like, but I don't want my face smelling like that.  Furthermore, fragranced skincare products can cause irritation, but I have used some scented products on my face without consequence, so I gave this one a try.  Unfortunately, I can't get past the smell.  The pros of this product is that the formulation is very clean, it's vegan and cruelty free, and it wasn't all that irritating, considering it has glycolic acid in it.  This is probably because of the addition of things like aloe.  If you get this product, start out with the 10 piece travel size so you can make sure you can tolerate the smell.  Once you wipe these on your skin, your face wont stop smelling like orange-vanilla, so make sure you like it before buying the full pack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "182781  I bought this product on a lark. I struggle with dark, large under eye circles and I'm always on the lookout for the next, best thing. Creams, serums, concealers, whatever. This product seems to have a slight blurring, reflective quality that does lesson the dark appearance. It is moisturizing, even a tiny bit greasy, but not enough to be a deal breaker. I think if you only have slight darkness under your eyes, this cream alone could be enough for you. In my case, I still need concealer. To my surprise, the product still works under concealer, making it more effective. My main complaint is the packaging. When I first opened the container, I was angry and sure that I had just bought a used product! It wasn't until I read reviews that I realized that the little jar is about 80% empty by design. Who thought that was a good idea? When I buy expensive, high-end products I expect to be pleased-- even delighted-- with the packaging. It's part of the overall experience and I suspect one of the reasons many of us indulge in pricey skin care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "191259  These masks are basically standard sized - slightly wider across the face but not as tall from nose to chin. They are by no means an extra large mask. i would have returned them if they were eligible for return. Bought 4 masks, feel like I was cheated out of $40 by DXL who represents their products as sized for larger men (trust me I have shopped at DXL and at their predecessor).  Have given these masks to family members since they were useless to me. The question is what is DXL going to to to make this right and retain me as a customer? I will update this in 1 week to let the public know what has transpired and if DXL does the right thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
      "192388  I bought this to replace a really old fitbit zip and I was most interested in the sleep stats.  One day I felt my wrist getting hot and when I took off the watch there was a small eraser sized burn mark.  Apparently there have been lawsuits against fitbit for these wrist burns.

      "193896  I didn't realize this was a glitter puzzle because the picture shown on the website is of the original artwork, minus the glitter. That was a little deceptive. Read the title/description carefully. The glitter covers up the detail and beauty of the original picture and makes the puzzle more difficult. This was my first Bits and Pieces puzzle. I enjoyed the unique puzzle pieces, but the glitter was a huge disappointment. Minus 3 stars just because of the glitter. Otherwise, I would have given 5. I look forward to doing another Bits and Pieces puzzle because I loved the unique shapes and good quality; but NO glitter for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "207134  I have been using Vistaprint for many years. Recently I engaged the services of their company Promotique beginning in April of this year. Since that time I have placed 7 different orders totaling $427.88. I have had issues with every single order I have placed with their Promotique company starting with the first order where I was sent a defective item. This order was made on April 7th and did not receive my item until May 4th, weeks after the promised delivery date. On another order they screwed up, I was promised 15% off my next order and never received that promised discount. Now I ordered several items on June 6th and received all those items with the exception of two more than a week ago and those two remaining shirts from that order remain \"processing\" when the promised deliver date is tomorrow. Meanwhile, two days ago I placed an order for the exact same shirt and it already shows that order for the same item made two days ago as shipped, yet these two others from my June 6 order remain processing. I called their customer service dept on June 21st and advised the representative I intended to file a complaint with the BBB and in retaliation, was just put on hold and left there. After 17 minutes I hung up. I have customers waiting for these items and I'm not having to issue refunds and apologies to my customers which is unacceptable. This company is messing up my reputation that I have worked hard to build because of their unprofessional business practices, misrepresentation and unreliability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
      "208959  Good tires but Forrest told me I could get a discount on them for coming there and them not being there because the truck with them in there broke down and I had to drive 80 both ways 2x to get there and wasted my time but I got cheated out of my discount because forest didn't check me out the second time so y'all owe me some money                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
      "209228  I was hoping to get a smaller guitar and with the stores closed I thought I'd try one from Musician's Friend..  I like Yamaha and have a full size, but this 3/4 size just doesn't make it.  Then I was so shocked to find out that UPS wanted 79 to send it back and FedEx 75 --for a 200 guitar.  Maybe it's not fair, but II feel like I've been cheated by Musician's Friend.  I won't be ordering a guitar again online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
      "209392  I loved the easy ride with the wheels--you can handle more than one when needed easily.  I find the multiple zippers cumbersome in that it's hard to tell which is the main one at times.  Would be great if there was better distinction.  The suitcases held up well through two trips by airline however the airline baggage process did manage to rip off the Samsonite emblem but the rest of the suitcase is intact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "216305  BUYER BEWARE\\nWe purchased this three piece living room set and were so excited.  Unfortunately, there is a five inch damage in the material on top of the center compartment of the loveseat.  Called BJ's online customer service and the representative told me to contact the manufacturer customerservice@margecarson.com because we already received the furniture and it comes with a one year guarantee.  Well guess what Marge Carson Furniture NEVER heard of BJ's Wholesale and claims they did not make that furniture.  Took the model number looked it up on line and it comes up with Global Furniture once again this company NEVER heard of BJ's Wholesale and did not make this furniture.  We called customer service approximately eight times and five of the times never received a call back and was disconnected the other three times.  Called two different stores in my area asking who to contact was put on hold at Fairless Hills, PA store for 45 minutes and when I called back calls were forwarded to a fax machine.  The other store just rang for over two hours off and on and no one in customer service picked up the phone.  I contacted the corporate office and naturally got voice mail.  I am not holding my breath for this individual to get back to me, however I will give the benefit of doubt.  BJ Wholesale FALSE ADVERTISING on furniture products and not even knowing manufacturer and product information is a poor representation on them as a company.  The best part is the worthless WARRANTY.  The other two people that wrote 5 star reviews were very fortunate.  I just hope that there sets last a long time because there is no where to get information or a replacement on this furniture.  On the good note the set is comfortable and nice, but the material does not look very durable.  I am so disappointed in BJ's Wholesale I have been a member for over 20 years and never have I been treated so badly by any companies customer service department.                                                                  \n",

      "218123  As quickly as I bought it I had to return it. It has sooo much dimethicones I can't see how it mattifies the skin? I waited 10 mins after application & it was still greasy, never really sunk into the skin & it BURNED MY CHEEKS! My skin felt hot to the touch & really red. I guess it's claims of \"for sensitive skin\" is false advertising.it has WAY too many unnecessary ingredients,  like a book long! Jesus christ. I had to wash my face immediately but its still burning & red.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
      "220474  Tricked by a pop up at the end of placing my order for other items.  It showed the flashlight and said \"FREE\", in big bold letters, if added to your order in the next ?? seconds.  Click here.  I didn't need a flashlight but thought, well if it's free I'll just use it as a stocking stuffer, so I clicked.  I was appalled when I viewed my order confirmation and saw that I had been charged $55.07 for it.  I didn't really need a flashlight, especially a $55 one.  I tried immediately to cancel the order but their email inbox was full and not accepting messages.  I also was unable to get through by telephone, but I kept trying and when I finally got through, it was shipped already.  Of course I can return it for credit, but they will deduct  the shipping cost.  Apparently somewhere on the popup it was clarified that the rush to CLICK NOW was to get free shipping (only).

      "238811  Eddie Bauer lost a valued customer. I have sworn by Eddie Bauer jackets, but you guys have an awful back end support and customer service team. I ordered a jacket for my husband during Christmas sale in December which showed available online and after 10 days of placing the order, eddie bauer cancelled the order saying the product is not available and cannot be shipped. Now please understand that nor have I only lost all the deals from other competitive out wear companies like North face and Columbia, but have also not received a winter jacket to protect myself. \\n\\nAfter that, I ordered a woman's jacket in January for which the same thing happened, it showed in stocks online and after purchasing they emailed to say its out of stock. \\nPost which, still having the faith in the company, I tried purchasing the jacket again as it showed in stocks for my size and to my disappointment the jacket was shipped to a wrong address. Upon investigation, the courier company returned the jacket to the eddie bauer return facility (still wondering how did they manage to do that). This almost seems like the company does not want the customer to have the jacket.\\n\\nNow I have absolutely lost faith in eddie bauers ability to help me with any service or product. As per ecommerce laws, it's fraudulent to misrepresent that a product is available and then say it's not in stock. After speaking to the customer service team, they would like me to repurchase the jacket at the listed price right away as the size and color of the jacket was rarely available. I was travelling in 5 days and had no patience to go through the whole ordering process and hoping that it would be fulfilled, so I requested a refund for the amount. I had used gift cards worth CAD 159 and the customer service representative confirmed that I would receive the full refund for the product on my credit card. After a few days only part of the amount was refunded and they denied the refund noting that only store credit will be issue              \n",
      "241090  I researched washers for days before deciding on this machine. \\nMy decision was based on the 5-year warranty, reputation, on-line and Consumer Report reviews and recommendations from friends who loved their Speed Queen machines.   It was replacing a 14 yr. old Whirlpool that had served us well but was no longer repairable.   The machine is solid and has a small footprint which I really like.   I initially loved how it washed but am now 6 months down the road and not impressed.    In addition to already having to call for repair service for a malfunctioning balance ring, I found out from customer service AND the repair tech that the pre-set Normal/Eco cycle (which is pre-set to wash on \"warm\") actually only washes on COLD regardless of what temperature is chosen.  I was shocked and angry because it is misleading.   When I stated to Customer Service that it's basically fraud to show that a cycle is washing on one temp when it's really washing on another regardless of what temperature is chosen, the response was \"The government makes us do it.\"    This alone makes me not want to recommend it to anyone but there are quirks as well.   If I don't put socks and small items in a mesh laundry bag, they tend to \"land\" in the rim during the wash cycle and just get stuck there.   I can't just wash a small load of anything or it goes off-balance during the spin cycle and basically locks up and displays an error message that only clears after it's been unplugged and plugged back in to reset it....at which point it starts all over again.   Sometimes this happens during (what I would consider) a \"normal size\" load.   It seems this machine does best with liquid detergent, not laundry pods.   When I use a laundry pod, I tend to have to add several extra rinses just to get the soap out.   Overall, I regret spending nearly $2,000 on this machine.   Maybe the top loaders are good, but Speed Queen needs to do some work on their front loader.                                                                 \n",
      "241469  These are more stretchy than most nail stickers, which made it a bit harder to just rip off on the tips of my nails, and use the other half. However, I was able to figure it out, and use them as well as other brands.  I don't care for the Dashing Diva brand, and find them too stiff.  The brands I enjoy are Color Street, the old Sally Hansen (which I can't find anymore), and Incoco.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Looks like I got a returned \"basement \" item, because there was dirt on the bottoms of the soles and they looked gently worn. Oh well, I thought...I DID just buy them for 25 dollars. Fast forward to me wearing them...such a snug fit in the calf, I have caused Charlie horses trying to remove them! The suction is so strong! Yes, they keep my feet warm and dry, but if I don't take the time to properly and completely pull them up, I get a rub so bad on the back of my lower calf. And I even sized up!

      "246326  I thought the shorts would be loose at the hem for a slightly A-line or skort look but it's not. It tapers from the hip down. It deeats the purpose of using relaxed linen and it's not flattering. I ordered red and the blue-white strips. The fabric for the red one is too stiff. The blue-&-white one is much more relaxed and comfortable. But I returned both because they're just not flattering on.\\n\\nP.S. When I ordered them, I didn't know they're final sales because it's not stated besides the price. I was surprised when I saw it on the packaging slip. I called Boden. I was told it's stated in the return policy that any price with \".99\" would be final sales. In the US, this is in deceptive sales preactices territory because no customer would check return policy for each merchandise ordered. \"Final Sale\" is always marked right by the discounted price on website here. Boden is nice enough to make an exception for me. I recommend Boden to make \"Final Sale\" clear on the product page since you're selling to American consumers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "249953  So far I really enjoy this furniture! My one complaint is that the picture shows seems to show not only the two star age draws on the footboard, but also two on either side for a total of six. That is not the case. It is just two drawers for the queen size bed frame. Since I was expecting there to be six drawers I was very disappointed initially.

      "251077  I tried this product as directed and at first everything was fine, but after about a month my eyelids became itchy, red, and dry. I stopped using it and these issues went away, and I was not using any other new products so it was obvious this was the culprit. I tried it again a month later and once again the issues started. Curious, I looked up the ingredients and discovered that one of them is a known drug that other companies such as Rodan and Fields are getting sued over- isopropyl cloprostenate. Look it up. I'm actually lucky I didn't suffer worse side effects like so many others have. Buyer beware!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

      "255072  My Willson 3100 BBb tuba is too think from the front action piston valves to the back of the horn for the flap to zip up and close.  See photo.

Some robot message about ISO standards. Well, Brother, shove your ISO standards. Obviously, they are erroneous. Get onto the problem, show some progress and please stop scamming us with the toner because we want to use your printer, we love your printer, but it doesn't feel good to be cheated.

      "256581  Like most products, the key to this one is to use it for what it's designed for. It's a gun locker. A good one, but nevertheless, it's a locker. This is not a safe and the vast majority of people, including the manufacturer, are not claiming this is designed to be impenetrable and theft-proof. Mounting it under a bed adds another layer of security in that how many people can contort themselves and use tools effectively? More importantly, just how many professional thieves are coming to make a concentrated attack for 1 or 2 guns of unknown value? I purchased this to have ready access to my shotgun while keeping it safe from our child and any typical smash and grab petty thief that's statistically in and out of a house in less than 7 minutes. The Ocean's 11 crew is not coming for my shotgun. It's built well, the electronics are sufficient and it serves the intended purpose well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "256980  You showed the $50 coming out of my total until the very end. Then i was charged the full amount.

      "257188  I've been a Citi card holder for some time and over the years they have really done a great job of improving both their services and customer service both of which left a lot to be desired. I really enjoy the card benefits and ease with which any issues I may have are handled. More importantly I recently experienced fraudulent purchases and Citi contacted me immediately to advise of their findings/confirm the purchase. Once I informed them I had not made the purchase the card was canceled and I received a new card a week later. That to me is priceless in today's society. So I will continue to be a happy Citi customer!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
      "257490  The cards were beautiful , but the envelopes were terrible. I paid extra money for A lined envelope. However, they were stickers that I was supposed to insert myself. The stickers were clearly old and did not rip off properly nor did they stick properly. I sent all my cards out in  regular envelopes, no liner.

      "259636  This is the card I trust to get the most bang for my buck. The rewards are substantial and the extra perks of car rental insurance and no foreign transaction fees are also fantastic. I have had to dispute a fraudulent charge and their customer service is amazing and it was taken care of in a timely manner combined with professionalism and kindness. Thank you!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "261536  The bags ripped at the top seam. The holes for the drawstrings were off-center so even if they hadn't ripped off, it would still be unusable.

      "262740  I will start with one positive - the masks are well sewn, this is where the positive ends.\\nThe design is a bit weird, huge gaps on the sides, not sure how much protection they provide.\\nThe pattern is ok, the fabric is not, rough and too thick, not for CA weather and not for sensitive skin. Also wrinkled almost immediately.\\nFalse advertising and information- at the time I placed my order the images featured masks with the usual LB leaf, then they changed the image to disclose the full brand name. I never buy anything featuring the brand name, I feel like I pay my hard earned money to provide free advertising. If like they say they are working hard to make as many masks as they can, why waste more money and labor to attach this huge brand name label? \\nLastly, it says \"made in LA\" , well mine took 10 days to be delivered to San Diego because they were shipped from Walton, KY!

      "265205  Chance of a Lifetime by Jude Deveraux and Tara Sheets is the first novel in the Providence Falls series.  This book reminds me of Jude Deveraux's early novels which I just loved (Wishes, A Knight in Shining Armor, Sweet Liar).  I thought the story contained good writing and it moved along at a steady pace. The story has humor, drama, mystery, and, of course, romance.  I liked the characters with my favorite being Liam O'Connor.  He is a thief, a charmer, and a rogue.  I like that Chance of a Lifetime combines the present in Providence Falls with Liam and Cora's tale from 1844.  The parallels between the two time periods was intriguing.  And let us not forget the two heavenly judges determined to keep Liam on task.  I liked the humor in the story as it added lightness and levity.   I enjoyed reading Chance of a Lifetime until I got to the end and realized the story was incomplete.  I must now wait for the next installment in the Providence Falls series to find out the identity of the killer (I have an idea and want to see if I am right) and Liam's fate.  Jude Deveraux and Tara Sheets combine history, romance, mystery, and heavenly intervention into one engaging tale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "267151  This grill looks great, but I'm mystified as to why Consumer Reports would recommend this grill.  It is clearly made from shoddy materials and you will spend the price you paid over again within 2 years on replacement parts.  I'm actually questioning whether or not I should continue to trust CR based on them recommending this grill.  I feel ripped off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

      "270479  Purchased in 2019. Had an issue with motor not supporting above 17mph. Freemans Bridge in Scotia NY did a great job trouble shooting the issue. Ended up replacing head unit. Only bike I have ever owned that receives compliments and people taking pictures of it. Replaced tires with the ones that came on the 6.0. They look better and I'm always riding in fair weather on pavement. The fenders are well made and actually have spacers for wheel clearance. I removed one at each point to fit the larger tire. Bike is well made with attention to detail. I'm pretty big and over 200lbs. Wanted the better specs as well as motor battery set up. Bike is powerful and can climb. It is heavy. The 4.0 looks good if you are lighter and ride the flats. Speaking of flats....I installed self sealing tubes as I did have a flat. Not an easy task without moving computer and bell to turn upside down. Also upgraded to Brooks Saddle and bar end mirror off Amazon. Drilled out grip end to install plug in handle bar. Purchased Rack Time bag on Amazon.  I would recommend this bike for someone who wants to trek long distances without running out of battery. The XT set up is great and the brakes are two piston not four, Price point just dropped. Feel cheated a bit but that's how technology rolls.   \\n\\nPS Mission Control. Use it all the time to record my trips. Not to many adjustments you can do but the data is nice.

      "276088  My wife and I bought our Champion dual fuel inverter generator 2 years ago for our RV. We are mostly dry camping with no shore power so we wanted something to charge our (large) battery bank once a day, it had to be quiet, it had to have clean power for our electronics and it had to have electric start. The Champion ticked all those boxes, plus it was a dual fuel, which meant no gasoline in the back of the SUV. We've never run it on gasoline, just propane so far. Even when it's been sitting a while, it starts on the first crank.\\n\\nIt's a great product and I would have given 5 stars, but given Champion customer service, it deserves 6 stars. We moved house last summer and somehow we lost the propane regulator and hose. I called Champion to order a replacement figuring it was going be be a $200 rip off. I called Champion support, explained what had happened and asked to order a replacement. The service representative took my name and address, did some work on his computer and said \"we're done\". When I asked what the price was, he said they were sending me one free as a courtesy.

      "285673  After loving the 🍑 pallete and it's delicious peachy scent I was very excited to try pumpkin spice however after receiving it I am feeling very disappointed. The pallete has NO scent whatsoever and the pigments on some of the shimmer shadows are weaker than I expected. \\nI could probably look past the shadows but not the fact it is sold as pumpkin scented and has no hint of scent.\\nI generally love my too faced products but feel quite cheated with this one unfortunately :(                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

      "292843  This school will cheat you every way they can, from charging you for printer paper, to increasing tuition and activities fees during covid-19 for no reason other than that they will lose profits if they don't. They're \"non-profit\" while paying administration $400,000+ per year and underpaying faculty to a pathetic degree. They overcharge students for tuition that could be easily matched by a school half this price, and constantly spend ludicrous amounts of money on the places they show touring prospective students, and leave everything else without proper upkeep or maintenance for years on end. They intentionally make it hard to transfer out or get your money back from anything, please read the fine print if you attend this school. Can say this as an active senior during covid, this school is pathetically focused on their bottom line and does not care about you, barely avoids qualifying as a scam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

That being said, we are on the most part coming together & working to get through this virus as a country, I have been trying to get a bottle for weeks & have watched the prices rise daily on Amazon, today, it is up to $105.95 for a 24 pack, this is OUTRAGEOUS, ILLEGAL & UNACCEPTABLE.  As many have supported your product, this is time for you to stand for your consumers-WILL YOU HELP US & LET US, WHAT WILL YOU DO?

      "312678  This is very disappointing.  The product is not as represented. Does not suit my complexion. Doesn't last more than 30 minutes. Doesn't improve skin as suggested. Should not be a salable item on tsc. Everything about all the items are incorrect as they were represented.  Very disappointing to me that the claims are intentionally deceptive by both host and creator of this product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "314885  When I showed up 15 minutes before closing with a mail in my tire, I was concerned I would not be able to get it fixed in time and unsure how I would get home safely. The entire staff was kind and helpful to me, as no one rushed me and everyone worked efficiently. Prices were fair and I did not feel that I was being ripped off, but rather taken care of and valued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

      "316744  I was very excited to receive this bike - I had done research on bikes that are less expensive than Peloton but offer a good workout and are easy to use with Peloton mobile app. The bike is easy to set - took my husband and I almost a half hour.  Bike is quiet and easy to use. The resistance does not match Peloton but there are conversions available online. After a week of use, the left pedal ripped off the arm crank. The threading where the pedal screwed in was coming completely out. I am assuming that the quality control has decreased some with the pandemic and Schwinn Fitness trying to meet demand. I called customer service and waited 2.5 hours to speak to a representative for a replacement arm crank and pedal and was told it will take up to 60 days to receive. I was able to rig the pedal up so that I can still ride without coming out of the saddle. Disappointing to have to wait so long for replacement parts especially since the bike is less than a month old. I enjoy the bike overall and am eager to receive my replacement parts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "324000  Got this palette directly from CP, thinking I had ordered another. (Duh!). Very fond of my mistake!  This seems a more original take on a 'red family' palette with maroon, purple-ish, peach tones, etc. CP has become iffy, but this palette has even pigmentation, ease of app and blendability. Transition and browbone shades are included, unless you insist on neutrals for that purpose. BBB is actually quite easy to 'read.'  So many combos, both warmer and cooler 'jump out at you' on both the warmer and cooler sides.  Using 'Easy' as a descriptor is a bit deceptive, as this one can go from one and done to a 5+ look.  This is not a one-note 12.  You know, where all the looks are far too similar? BBB does contain plastic glitter, as well as  pigments that are considered not eye safe by the FDA, but ok by EU cosmetics standards. Ulta disclosed this, which is a plus in my book.  Honesty.  Not sure i ever goofed on a palette order before, but I'm enjoying BBB immensely.  Glad that Ulta is offering this, as it is no longer available at CP.  BBB deserves more notice than it received.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "324252  I bought a jacket as a Christmas gift. I included the return slip, so the recipient could return it if necessary. She did return it although she was told that it might take months to get the item she exchanged for my gift.. Then I was charged for approximately $16 difference between the item I gave her and her return. As your customer representatives explained your return policy, compared to most business return policies, yours is a very convoluted, confusing, and indefensible return policy. That person also said the recipient should not have included the return slip because anyone can then use it for fraudulent purposes, but the rep never explained why or what a customer is supposed to do with that document. Why include it? \\nTo be clear, your policy has left me holding the bag for over $16.\\nLet me repeat, I will never buy from North Style again. Take my name off your catalog list.

      "341344  I brought the product as this had integrated Alexa control. But skip song does not work and immediately after playing it stops playing the playlist. Looking online it looks like this problem has been around for many months. Very annoying. Also Sonus is not a total replacement for my PC Speakers … which is not made clear in the sales material.

      "343319  With tax and shipping, I spent $67.38 and you only returned $43.49.  This is a rip-off - I should have gotten $49.98 + $4.41 tax.  I can see you keeping the $12.99 for shipping & processing, but you are not entitled to any more.  I will never do business with you again, and I will go to social media to let everyone know                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

      "350720  Their ok if you get them on sale and just need a mask for the sake of wearing a mask and they are better than no mask BUT... \\n\\nThere is no way there are 3 layers in these masks. Maybe at one time they had 3 and the website hasn't been updated? But I pulled mine that I just bought yesterday apart and it's just 2 layers and the outside printed fabric is quite thin with a lower thread count. The nose wire is also not very affective and doesn't really hold its shape well so the masks are useless for my husband who wears glasses because of the gapping around the nose. \\n\\nDisappointing quality for a GAP product and not what I expected from how they are advertised online. Quite frankly I feel like I was cheated because if says on the website that they are 3 layers and they are not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "354356  Terrible experience! I purchased two pairs on the bogo offer. I sent an email asking if I needed to return both to receive refund. I just wanted to send one back and order a different color. Which I did. I never received a response. It's been over two weeks. I was still charged full price for the other shoes and received a very minimal refund. I wasn't aware that I needed to return the whole order and re-purchase to receive refund. Very deceptive. Be careful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "365442  Brought this flooring on an online promotion while renovating our home. Packaging arrived stating Albero why would I question it.....right ? \\nWent away for a night with children so fitters could lay in all areas and came home to ABSOLUTE disappointment!!! the flooring is NOTHING like the images online it does not have the dark grooves as advertised and is a shade of blue grey not a oak grey ! I sent customer services a comparison image of the flooring I was sent and had laid  next to the flooring that was being advertised and they dont seem interested in the fact that they are advertising the product wrong as long as my boards match the \"master board\"  and that the online images are for and I quote \" illustration purposes\" this flooring resemble the Aspen flooring they are advertising not the image they have online for for the Albero . Wickes are not interested in dealing with how there product does not resemble there advertisement and try to put the blame on the customer for not checking this .....I also purchased kitchen floor tiles which funnily enough look EXACTLY like the image online ??? SO is the customer really wrong here? This is  FALSE ADVERTISING and after my feedback I would be very concerned with purchasing online again if the images are not based on actual products .....Very concerning !!\\n\\nOh by the way .....\\n\\n * illustration purposes means use to show that what you are saying/selling is true or to make the meaning clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
      "367093  In the picture these look like they will be multi coloured lights....but this is deceptive. They are actually all clear plastic and morph all at once...... so individual star lights are all the same colour all the time, changing en mass! Not what I wanted at all and disappointing.\\n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

      "373731  Don't do it. Don't buy this one!!! I applied it and first thing you notice is the alcohol smell. Next it dries quickly but was IMPOSSIBLE to take off. 20+ minutes later I ripped off allll my facial hair. Worst part, now I have a hairier face than I had because I ripped off all the little hairs on my face. Because it ripped off all my hair my skin was red and very irritated. I don't recommend this at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "3113    Raccoon eyes This mascara was terrible!  Halfway through my day I had raccoon eyes!

      "4547    No I bought these grips about a month ago and initially really liked their feel. Really soft rubber, very grippy, and comfortable. Not too much texture or stuff in the way, and they fit my hands well. It even reduced hand fatigue in comparison to specialized trail grips.\\n\\nHowever after about a month of riding, a few times a week, they're already showing signs of ware on the grip pattern. Additionally the grip ends aren't very durable at all. They ripped off the first time I laid my bike down on a turn.\\n\\nI think these would be good for riders looking for a high level of comfort, aren't too rough on their bikes, or don't mind replacing grips often. If you take a lot of risks on the trail or are new to the sport I would look for something more durable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "13613   Need look into the problem I am so disappointed. This is a replace one, my original one is very loosed, cannot hold the power, but this new, replaced one is the same. I am checked, it is too shallow when plug in, so is very loosed, I have to use something to have it hold in plug in/connection position but still very easy yo lost connection/cord. Since this is the new one but shows the same problem as the original one, my conclusion is that the pot's power slot is not fit with the power cord!!!!!!!! This is a simple thing, but IP did show the design defect. I like the pop, but cannot believe that there is such a simple, but design defect! If other types pops are the same, I am a fraud that I will not buy again - a lot of hassles, sometime during cook, it lost connection, lost the power, even I use something to hold the cord in the place. I use all kind appliances which using electrical and have the power cords, I never even encounter the loosed power cord that cannot hold the connection. I think your tach/design department should take the problem seriously, and solve the problem in the future product, otherwise you will lost the customers. I hate to say so because I like the pop in general, but this is a basic condition - if all functions of the product are excellent, but no power, just would not work.  BTW, I like the IP's services, so I hope it cannot improved and earn my trust again.\\nMindy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "14775   More than just a pillow!! The very first night I received the pillow an armed intruder burst into my bedroom. He pointed a .357 magnum at me and out of share instinct I put the pillow in front of me. I heard 3 gun shots ring out, but to my surprise, not a single 1 penetrated the pillow. This also stunned the burglar and in his moment of bewilderment I swung the pillow at him as hard as I could. It hit him square on his left side and sent him crashing face first into my dresser. Blood spilled from his clearly broken nose as I loaded up for my ensuing  back swing. I don't have the best accuracy swinging this way and caught him on his left knee causing it to buckle backwards in a horrific 90 degree angle. The burglar dropped to floor and the gun toppled from his hand. As he scrambled to regain control of the revolver I hoisted the pillow over my head (this thing weighs more than most sledge hammers) and brought it down squarely on his back, snapping his spinal column. \\n     I had to pay cleaners $500 to get all the blood stains out of the carpet, I was arrested for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and I'm being sued by the burglar for his medical expenses and trauma, but this pillow is so comfortable I sleep as if I don't have a care in the world. \\n4 out 5 stars because it weighs NINE POUNDS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "14835   Online Account Access Locked In an effort to practice social distancing I set up zelle to transfer money from my Chase account to another outside bank account. I made several attempts to get it working because both banks had the same phone and email info. As a result my online access was locked and I received an email to call customer service. Once I called and explained my situation I went through a series of verifications to establish my legitimacy and access was granted and my transaction completed. With all of the fraudulent activity going on I am so grateful for the stringent guidelines Chase took to lock my account and verify that I am the account owner before granting me access again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "15612   Midwayusa ALWAYS Delivers! I am posting this is in response to Erad's unwarranted review. I have ordered 10,000+ factory 2nds and blemished bullets, various calibers, and have always been ecstatic with the value that Midwayusa offers them at. With all the multiple orders I have made on factory 2nds I have came across multiple bullets that I would consider \"out of spec\" even had some packaged with different weights; 143gr eld and 147 eld's for example. That being said, if you ALWAYS follow safe reloading practices, you'll stay safe. Use factory published load data for the exact components being loaded, start at the beginning load charge for powder, etc. When finding a bullet that is 0.001\" over-spec (ie 0.265\" vs 0.264\") implementing these reloading \"Golden Rules\" will ensure you stay safe.  Erad's review is unwarranted because he is way off base accusing Midwayusa of fraud and must be a \"newb\" to reloading if he thinks 0.001\" will cause severe over-pressuer. That is why ANY reloading manual states over and over again to always use a starting load when developing a SAFE load. If Erad was to do that he would learn that the bullets he purchased would work and probably work well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
      "18626   A young lawyer's story of social justice and finding her pla A young lawyer's story of social justice and finding her place in the world.\\nYolanda Vance is a young African American recently graduated lawyer. Yolanda has had to single-mindedly strive and achieve to survive in a world that has left her essentially orphaned.  In her first job as an attorney at a prestigious corporate New York law firm, she is asked to shred documents in the middle of a raid by the FBI. The firm is guilty of securities fraud and Yolanda does the right thing and becomes a whistleblower. She is offered a position with the FBI, which she thinks will be a desk job. To her surprise, Yolanda is sent undercover to infiltrate an eco- and social justice activist group in California, who are taking on a large energy corporation with a defense contract. The activist group is seen as a threat by the FBI, but Yolanda quickly realizes that all is not that it seems and begins to question who the real criminals are.  Yolanda starts as a narrow, focused and, in some ways, naive character who grows and empowers herself throughout the story. A Spy in the Struggle explores a lot of interesting and relevant issues such as how racial, community, environmental and social justice all intersect. Like Yolanda, we, as readers, are led to contemplate and question what we see in our world and investigate what is occurring beneath the surface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "20529   I WOULD BUY THIS PRODUCT ANYTIME, DAY OR ELSE I absolutely LOVE this fragrance!  I have been wearing this scent every sense I found it in Dallas, TX in 1995 on a business trip!  This is my \"signature\" fragrance & I am sorely disappointed that the price has went through the roof!  I know that they discontinued it, but, do you have to price gouge with the remaining stock!  Just awful!  I won't buy it again until the price is reasonable like the rest of the fragrances.  DARN Shame!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
      "21765   Good product but beware of deceptive practices What I purchased is a good product.  The sales staff is deceptive and push you through the process and tell you they cannot do things that they clearly can such as not make you sign up for the optional insurance.  After you get sucked in to getting the insurance you then have to jump through hoops to get the insurance removed.  Customer service is no help as they direct you back to the store.  The store is little help as they don't know what to do and just give you a form to fill out instead of not making you sign up for the insurance to begin with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
      "23801   Frustrating. Frustrating. Wasted a lot  of time trying to use a coupon code and gift certificate at the same time. I got a notification that I would have to call because I tried to enter a code too many times, like I was doing something deceitful.  I was going to buy even more but decided your company does not appreciate paying customers. If I didn't have a gift certificate to use I would have canceled the full order. Will tell friends and family to avoid gifting from your company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "27526   Great Clothes! I am so glad to have discovered Duluth for plus size women! The clothes are comfortable, hearty, and fit incredibly well! \\n\\nMy visits to the stores have always been pleasant until my most recent. I bought a shirt for my Dad and needed to return due to size. I didn't have my receipt, but the shirt still had tags and the adhesive strip. The associate stated he needed to 'look it up,' trying to find when the item was sold. After several minutes of perusing, he stated he found the item and he was refunding me $9.95. I paid $22.50 for this shirt, so he said he would keep looking. A manager finally came over and asked the associate to return the item. It was a very frustrating experience. I don't like to be made to feel as though I'm lying or trying to cheat the system. Still love and recommend Duluth, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

      "38605   Samsung French door ( RF28K9380SR/AA) refrigerator I love the looks and storage of French Door refrigerators, just not happy with the ice maker. The design is flawed by trying to put the ice maker in thr warmer storage area instead of in the freezer portion. The Ice maker freezes up tight. I contact service that comes out, thaws out the ice maker giving me ice for about three months before freezing up again.\\nI have an extended warranty, but they are frustrated. I called Samsung and have had two service technicians attempt to fix it by replacing new parts. First such repair froze up again in 3 months.\\nI am tired of buying ice, and Samsung is silent after filing a BBB complaint. I am considering replacing the unit with another brand or a side-by-side with the ice maker in the freezer side.\\nBottom line: not happy with Samsung support of their product. I would stay away from Samsung products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "40519   Not hydrating I purchased this based off of the amazing reviews and now I feel cheated. Not only does this product not smell good, but it does NOTHING to moisturize hair! I purchased it with the matching shampoo, which overly dried out my hair. I thought maybe the conditioner would make up for it, but nope! The shampoo needs only a very small amount to lather but the conditioner requires HEAPS of it to add even the tiniest bit of moisture back to your hair. I would say the ratio of conditioner to shampoo is 20:1, so it's not exactly cost effective. It smells like drugstore baby shampoo to me, not honey or anything good. The scent was very off putting. The conditioner has ZERO slip and not even handfuls of it will add any slip to it. It almost feels like once you put it on your hair it just disappears. My hair was not soft, moisturized, nor did it smell pleasant after using this. I'm so confused how the ratings on this are so high. If you have dry or curly/wavy hair, stay away from this.

I'm thankful for the fraud protection, but not very happy with having to ship my order my home and hope it's still there by the time get home from work...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
      "45922   Never again This is my first and last time trying this product line. It does not have 10 speeds and it is barely working. I'm so disappointed, I had just made this in store purchase yesterday because they had this specific item its great and most popular item.  I was looking forward to the 10 speeds but it only has one and for something that has the word power in the title of the name it sure has none it is definitely barely working I would not recommend this item to anyone and will not be be purchasing any of this particular brand of products ever again. I definitely feel cheated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
      "47068   Still have not received the main item I ordered I ordered a pallet and a lipgloss. The lipgloss is the only thing I received. I made contact with customer care. It has been 3 weeks and they keep asking me questions as if I am a liar or a theif. I have no pallet and they still haven't made arrangements for me to either get the pallet or my money back.I will NEVER purchase from them again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "47114   FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!! Description states that this is the actual machine to trim nails, however, when I first received it was only a pack of 6 replacement rollers. Called customer service and was told that the correct product would be shipped out. Received the replacement and that too was just the pack of 6 replacement rollers. Never received the actual trimming machine as the description states. I was also charged for the replacement shipment when I was told there would be no charge as I did not receive what was advertised in the description the first time. DO NOT BUY!!

      "64845   I would buy this product again. The Ruger American Rifle is genius in its simplicity and effectiveness.  It is strong, easy to work, and accurate.  The bedding system is solid and well designed.  I own a few of these rifles.  If there was a fly in the ointment, it is its trigger.  It is the typical Glock style trigger marketed to us by Savage, Mossberg, and Ruger to name a few.  All touting how incredible it is.  It's really to keep them south of a lawsuit, and to many who grew up using good triggers from Winchester, Remington, and others, it stinks.  But marketers are good at telling us how red our blue shirt is and getting us to believe it.  So, I replaced mine with a Timney trigger.  And it is sweet sweet.  No take up, just a couple pounds of short pull and it breaks like a trigger should.  I have an old M70 Winchester with a nice \"smithed\" trigger that is perfection.  This Timney trigger comes so close to that right out of the box, that instead of paying smith fees in the future, I'll just install a new Timney.  It is easy to install and, if you know what a real good trigger should feel and perform like, then this is for you.  It makes a very good serviceable rifle into a great rifle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "68293   Money well spent! I absolutely love this!  I bought this for my home office which is an addition to the house and although I have a pellet stove which heats the rest of the house, this room never warmed enough for me.  Now I turn it on and it is so comfy that I want to go sit and do my work!  It is realistic and heats up with the click of the controller.  I was able to put the legs together with a simple screwdriver in 5 minutes!  Shown it to all my family members and everyone says the same thing - looks nice in the office and doesn't look cheap or phony.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "69106   CCat's LOVE these New packaging has both ends closed which makes it impossible to reverse side with out ripping off one end.  Additional, gives less room for cat to scratch.

I do enjoy on some occasions but it's not for you if you are a full glam type of enthusiasts.  its also a brand owned by estee lauder.  I take issues with estee lauder around marketing strategies and ethics but that's a personal decision.  as far as the foundation goes.  its a lovely formula if you are just wanting a daytime and out for a few hours type of foundation.  applying it quick style is sometimes pleasing.  but if you love the process of applying foundation then it's not a fun one. \\n..for reference.....\\nI have dry to combo skin. my shade range is fair/neutral with slightly warm dominance. my concerns are large pores on nose, minimal aging signs like a few fine lines and scarring but I am 38 with a conscience of skin health and a skin care routine that is realistic based on scientific reasoning.....not beauty industry deceptive marketing hypes. I have  sun damage from my skin health ignorance years where I didn't understand the efficacy of caring for my skin.  fyi....everyone with anti aging on the mind should use spf all year around including on the eyes.  no fancy anti aging or eye cream can fight off sun damage like spf topical formulas.  but spf in foundations is unnecessary to hike the prices and isn't adequate enough to protect.  and I am platinum blonde and blue eyes. my family is very diverse and I have very dark black skinned beauty enthusiasts within my circle and very pale white skin family too. so my recommendation is with all that in mind to recommend and purchase foundations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "75136   Enjoyed the book! Rick Renner, author of over 30 books has a new release set for September of 2020. Last Days Survival Guide: A handbook to prepare you for these perilous times.  When the book surprised me on my doorstep this summer and I opened the box my first thoughts were, \"yep this sounds about right.\"  In the middle of the Covid-19 2020 fest of one new stress-causing event after another, a book about survival is indeed a captivating read.  I received this book from Harrison House, @HarrisonHousePublishers as part of the launch team for an honest review.\\n\\nI have a feeling that many now feel that these are the end times, especially with a worldwide pandemic affecting every part of our lives, from how we work, dress, socialize, and even attend worship services.

      "76594   Nessie Plays Hide & Sea-k.com This came out much darker and much more green than the pictures led me to believe. It comes out as a very dark teal. I probably would have known better if I could have bought it in person but as it was during the Pandemic and I was quarantining at home (but also wishing for new Nail colors to play with) I did not see it in person and the online photos are VERY deceptive. Not as glittery as I was hoping for either.

      "79564   Just what I wanted, but a couple of things to know This safe is excellent, overall.  Well built, inside is so nice to protect whatever you put in it, great features and looks good.  My wife is even pleased with the appearance.\\nCouple of things I want to pass on from my experience setting it up...\\n1) It's heavy so get help moving and placing.\\n2) The serial number is on the back of the safe.  IT'S ALSO ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PACKING BOX!  If you have trouble someday getting into your safe, the serial number will allow Heritage Safe to help you back in, via codes or keys.  If someone checking trash removes the serial number from your disposed of box, they might be able to use it to scam codes or keys and get into your safe when your not home.  So, remove the serial number from the outside carton before disposal.\\n3) The 9V battery provided with the safe is poor quality.  Don't even bother to use it.  Put in a high quality 9V with a long shelf life and save yourself a headache later.\\nThat's about it.

      "94490   Color Not As Shown I got this shawl in 'malachite', which the picture shows as a nice dark grey. When i received it, it's actually a dark green.

      "95366   Nice product but........ Unlike many vegetarian 'bites' these aren't pappy but have a good firm texture and a good flavour too. They would have earned an extra star if it was not for the amount of fresh air in the box. The contents would have easily fitted into a box half the size. One can't help but feel ripped off when you open it. I don't really have space in my freezer for boxes of air plus I hate the waste involved in the extra packaging to surround it. (when will manufacturers wake up to the surplus packaging issue?) The only other,thing I can say is that it is quite pricey for the amount that you get in the box. OK fo just  me, but I wouldn't want to have to feed a family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "96764   Works, but velcro on 1 boot ripped off 1st use I like the way this works, but the lowest velcro strap ripped off and tore the the first time I used it overnight in my horse's stall.

      "101409  Almost a Perfect Pack.. Few Issues Need Fixed. The main side pocket is hardly usable when the main compartment is full.. The mesh pocket in the middle back of the pack doesn't stretch hardly at all compared to my Escapist pack, but I do like the stronger fabric on top of the stretch pocket to keep it from tearing.. Not sure why the company didn't put a huge Osprey logo on the center of the pack, as it would look way cooler if they did.\\n\\nMY BIGGEST GRIPE is with the water bottle holders.. They don't stretch near enough for bottles, especially when the pack is full. I have to force a Nalgene bottle into them with the pack off of me - I feel like they're going to rip off the pack and they have almost no stretch to them. The Atmos appears to have larger water bottle pockets and holes, as well as a larger loop to pull on for side loading of the water bottles. It's IMPOSSIBLE for me to use the side loads for water bottles on this pack; I could force a bottle into one with the pack off, but it would be jabbing me in the ribs/side the whole time, and the bottle angles down rather than up to fit in the pocket...\\n\\nThese few things need fixed to make this pack a true 5 Stars and to make me actually happy about it.\\n\\nOther than that, I love the side zipper to get into different depth of the main pack compartment. I also love that it comes with a rain fly - Atmos needs that in the USA version. The bottom compartment for a sleeping bag/bottom pack access is great too. I'd suggest slightly larger hip pockets too.. Something more like belly bag size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

      "108964  Completely disappointed in my ruined bra I was so excited to order this bra. My first brand new ck (I only owned thrifted previously) I thought the brand was a mark of quality. I was wrong. I ordered the largest size available at the time thinking they cared about size inclusivity and body positivity. Also wrong. \\nThe bra fit relatively comfortable yet a bit tight. Then after my first wash/air dry and second wear it completely fell apart at the seam of the band. I felt so cheated out of my hard earned. \\nI'm planning to take my business to a more inclusive brand like TomboyX. To get a product I can hopefully count on. \\nI hope the future of Calvin Klein corrects itself on where it's products are produced, along with the quality of them.

Lying and deceitful is too much to win a sale I'll stick with cheaper more knowledgeable and ethicaly bound auto retailers  see if they block the truth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "127592  Full power 20yr 10mm veteran. I shot it all. 155gr jhp underwood is my do it all round. Self defense, deer, bear defense. NOTHING ELSE comes close when it comes to power and accuracy. I shoot alot of cheap s&b 10mm for proficiency and fun but love to shoot these 155gr underwood fmj rounds here and there because they are cheaper than the jhp ammo and match ballistics and point of aim for le$$. Also it's insanely fast and powerful out of my thureon defense carbine with 2\" groups at 100 yds. In my ruger match champion revolver and and my g40 (oem barrel and 7.25\" KKM barrel) i can make 5 holes touch at 25 yds if shooting off a sandbag. Superb stuff.

      "130034  I got price gouged First, I'd like to say, CTD did a little price gouge on me when I bought these at the beginning of COVID-19. I bought these after adding them to my cart, a week later the price fell to its now normal price. I bought 3, one for myself and 2 as gifts. I tested all 3 before gifting them away. All 3 fed and fired. But I'll be honest I don't like the looks of the quality of the spring. I don't know how it will do under extended load, not just loading it and firing it all the next day. Great for the range, but obviously impractical For a carry item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
      "130897  Excellent product at a good price Purchased this when hand sanitizer became extinct in stores, and SO glad I did.  This is an excellent product.  I love that it's a liquid spray, not a gel.  It dries quickly.  It does not leave a residue or dry out your hands like other sanitizers.   I use this for sanitizing not just my hands, but all kinds of surfaces.  OK, yes... the odor is not exactly pleasant.  If you read some of the Amazon reviews some people say it smells like rotting flesh, poop, vomit, etc.   Those people are just being ridiculous.  The only thing it smells like is ethyl alcohol, which is exactly what it is.  Yes, it's strong, but as soon as it dries the smell is gone.   Not only do I like the product, but I appreciate the fact that Chemical Guys is manufacturing a product that we all need right now and they are selling it at a very reasonable price instead of trying to price gouge like so many others.

      "138395  Deceptive Practices Soured My Experience I ordered an in stock washer/dryer pair on 9/2/20. I should have seen red flags when other retailers said they couldn't fulfill the order for the same pair until 10/18/20. I placed the online order with Conn's, but my debit card transaction locked up the site. A phone call to support essentially said that I wasn't able to make the online order. After hanging up, I selected PayPal, and the transaction went through without issue. I again called customer service, as I wasn't able to select the delivery date for my order. Another red flag? I let the rep know that I was moving into a new house on 10/1/2020, and wanted delivery on that date. I was assured it would not be a problem and a note would be made. Less than a week later, I received an email telling me that the appliances would not be delivered until 10/18/20. I accepted, and called Conn's on 10/16/20 to confirm delivery would be on time and without issue. I was assured they would be.\\nOn 10/18/20, I got an email staying delivery would not be occurring that day. The next available date for delivery was 11/28/20. I contacted customer support to say this was unacceptable. After being transferred through several departments to ask when items would be in stock, I contacted the online orders department again. I was told that one of the two items was not in stock, but the same item in a different color was available. I was told that if I canceled and placed a new order, I could get it for the original sale price paid and within a few days. After placing the online order while the rep stayed on the phone, we found that the new items were not, in fact, in stock. With no other solution, my order had to be canceled for good. Overall, the online orders support was fantastic, but all other aspects of Conn's were very disappointing.                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

      "147401  Decent product, but packaging is deceptive AF. First cuticle balm I've used. Before using this, my cuticles were incredibly dry with many hangnails around it. It does a good job of moisturizing, but the shape is weird. Like a jumbo lipstick. \\n\\nI apply it directly to my cuticles and rub it in with my fingers. Been using it for a few weeks now and I have noticed a difference. I no longer get cracks and dryness around my fingers. Also, I feel like it helped get rid of my hangnails. \\n\\nI recommend applying it at night as it's quite greasy. One point off for powdery old lady smell (I hate unnecessary fragrance in skin products) and another point off for deceptive packaging. The actual product took up about 1/4 of the tube. \\n\\nStill on the hunt for a good cuticle balm, but this one isn't bad for a first time user. Been trying to take better care of my hands. Handwashing is vital especially since Covid hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
      "150064  Not 8ozs! Love French's Yellow Mustard and have been using it for years. However, for the first time today, I needed 3/4 of a cup for a recipe. I opened a brand new 8oz bottle and guess what? There only 3/4 of a cup in the container, NOT 8 ozs!! So we're not getting what we're paying for. Not that it's expensive, but it is false advertising.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Otherwise you will be wasting your time and money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "155920  No contact is not actually available at ACE The product is fine.  Absolutely fine and there is not difference between buying this product from two different sources.  However, I bought this product to try to support my local business and all I wished to do was do it with no contact, however I was forced to have contact with the person to sign for something like $11 worth of material.  I have not had to do that in the past.  I was told that it was because there was credit card theft going on, to which I can only say that a decent thief would probably do better than 4 electrical boxes for their big heist.  All that said, I won't be coming back until after the pandemic.  I'll go find my stuff on amazon or ebay.  It appears that it's safer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
      "156589  Not safe for unsupervised sleeping I registered for this bassinet based on stellar reviews on this website as well as target and amazon and received it as a gift. Nowhere in any of the product details does it include the fact that this is not safe for unsupervised sleeping. I was looking through the Q&A on targets website to determine whether I could buy sheets for this product and came across answers directly from the company that this is not recommended for unsupervised or overnight sleeping. The advertising feels deceptive as it is marketed as being designed for sleep. I tried to write this review on target as well and they did not publish it so I think the positive reviews are likely inflated. Buyer beware.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

      "160295  It's good but I feel a little deceived This item had a hard start for me, I ordered during the COVID issue but wanted to support a friend didn't even think the wait would be extended so long.  Then upon getting the popper, I was pretty sure I got the wrong item, but it ships collapsed!  Looks very small in the HUGE box it was shipped in, but alls well.  Also I found the reason for the wait.  Made in China (not Vietnam - like on site) so I'm sure the delay was in manufacturing and customs (not at US packaging facility like implied on website).   \\nThings got better from there,  on my first pop, I used Orvile Reddenbackers (our standby for consistent popping corn) and no oil/butter  It did a good job!  not too many old maids (shhh) it did exactly what was expected.  The lid did not pop off (saw in other reviews), bowl was VERY hot (so don't plan on using as serving bowl as website shows unless you plan on waiting a while).\\nOverall, getting past the wait & made in China (wish Pampered Chef would buy local), the popper did what it was supposed to do. but giving 3 stars for what I felt was a little deceptive marketing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
      "161978  Never received product! We ordered this product 21 days ago! Nearly a month ago! This was supposed to take 7 to 10 days to receive and we've never received the product. I have not received a refund and I have requested both. I called multiple times and only got through customer service once, after waiting for over an hour! At 1 hour and 18 minutes the lady that finally answered the call (who sounded nice and helpful) disconnected the call. So I got hung up on after an hour and 18 minutes, without her being able to help me at all. I messaged through the BJ's web site that day (a Thursday) and had to wait until the following week to hear back for their 2-3 business day wait period. Apparently it has been re-shipped again through their \"vendor\" but I only received a random tracking number without a way to track it. I have no idea what carrier this was sent through and therefore I have requested a link only to not hear back about that. Do not waste your time/money ordering this mattress!! I had planned on ordering another one but I will not as I am sure I will struggle to even get this mattress or a refund. I suppose we may have to go through our bank to dispute these charges as fraudulent. This has taken so much of my time it is absolutely ridiculous!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
      "162512  Are NOT 3D Compatible They looked like great bindings but were advertised as 3D compatible, so I paid for expedited shipping to get them sooner.  Not only were they NOT 3D compatible, EVO did not refund the expedited shipping when I returned them, even though I would never ever have ordered them had I known they wouldn't fit my old school Burton board.  It's false advertising and poor customer service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Everything was very good, but I was disappointed that the $15 marketing research credit (code DANKEAV1U19B) promised by Julie Genova was not acceptable. Since only 1 promo code is usable at a time, these $15 credits probably rarely get used, except for very small orders, where other promo codes would not apply.

      "171878  Super great breakfast, feels like a cheat! Great breakfast, so tasty when you want something warm. The egg takes more time to heat up, for some reason. I need to heat that seperalety. But I am used to that now and love this item. I add either hot sauce or ketchup or salsa, depending on what kind of mood I woke up in and it never fails-unless you leave it in the microwave too long or not enough, that is.

      "173149  The smell is a big nope for me I bought these on a whim because I love pacifica products (usually.. not universally, though).  I bought this one with the moisturizing one as well, both in travel size to test them.  I kind of had them in mind for my \"cheat\" days when I don't feel like doing my full skincare routine but I don't want to go to bed having done nothing.  I'll start with what I don't like.  The smell is so overpowering and sweet.  The fragrance is like an orange creamsicle, which maybe you like, but I don't want my face smelling like that.  Furthermore, fragranced skincare products can cause irritation, but I have used some scented products on my face without consequence, so I gave this one a try.  Unfortunately, I can't get past the smell.  The pros of this product is that the formulation is very clean, it's vegan and cruelty free, and it wasn't all that irritating, considering it has glycolic acid in it.  This is probably because of the addition of things like aloe.  If you get this product, start out with the 10 piece travel size so you can make sure you can tolerate the smell.  Once you wipe these on your skin, your face wont stop smelling like orange-vanilla, so make sure you like it before buying the full pack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "182781  Good product with deceptive packaging I bought this product on a lark. I struggle with dark, large under eye circles and I'm always on the lookout for the next, best thing. Creams, serums, concealers, whatever. This product seems to have a slight blurring, reflective quality that does lesson the dark appearance. It is moisturizing, even a tiny bit greasy, but not enough to be a deal breaker. I think if you only have slight darkness under your eyes, this cream alone could be enough for you. In my case, I still need concealer. To my surprise, the product still works under concealer, making it more effective. My main complaint is the packaging. When I first opened the container, I was angry and sure that I had just bought a used product! It wasn't until I read reviews that I realized that the little jar is about 80% empty by design. Who thought that was a good idea? When I buy expensive, high-end products I expect to be pleased-- even delighted-- with the packaging. It's part of the overall experience and I suspect one of the reasons many of us indulge in pricey skin care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "191259  Extra Large? These masks are basically standard sized - slightly wider across the face but not as tall from nose to chin. They are by no means an extra large mask. i would have returned them if they were eligible for return. Bought 4 masks, feel like I was cheated out of $40 by DXL who represents their products as sized for larger men (trust me I have shopped at DXL and at their predecessor).  Have given these masks to family members since they were useless to me. The question is what is DXL going to to to make this right and retain me as a customer? I will update this in 1 week to let the public know what has transpired and if DXL does the right thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
      "192388  Stay away I bought this to replace a really old fitbit zip and I was most interested in the sleep stats.  One day I felt my wrist getting hot and when I took off the watch there was a small eraser sized burn mark.  Apparently there have been lawsuits against fitbit for these wrist burns. Luckily mine happened during the 30 day return window                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "193896  The glitter ruined it for me. I didn't realize this was a glitter puzzle because the picture shown on the website is of the original artwork, minus the glitter. That was a little deceptive. Read the title/description carefully. The glitter covers up the detail and beauty of the original picture and makes the puzzle more difficult. This was my first Bits and Pieces puzzle. I enjoyed the unique puzzle pieces, but the glitter was a huge disappointment. Minus 3 stars just because of the glitter. Otherwise, I would have given 5. I look forward to doing another Bits and Pieces puzzle because I loved the unique shapes and good quality; but NO glitter for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

      "207134  NEVER RECEIVED, STILL SHOWS PROCESSING I have been using Vistaprint for many years. Recently I engaged the services of their company Promotique beginning in April of this year. Since that time I have placed 7 different orders totaling $427.88. I have had issues with every single order I have placed with their Promotique company starting with the first order where I was sent a defective item. This order was made on April 7th and did not receive my item until May 4th, weeks after the promised delivery date. On another order they screwed up, I was promised 15% off my next order and never received that promised discount. Now I ordered several items on June 6th and received all those items with the exception of two more than a week ago and those two remaining shirts from that order remain \"processing\" when the promised deliver date is tomorrow. Meanwhile, two days ago I placed an order for the exact same shirt and it already shows that order for the same item made two days ago as shipped, yet these two others from my June 6 order remain processing. I called their customer service dept on June 21st and advised the representative I intended to file a complaint with the BBB and in retaliation, was just put on hold and left there. After 17 minutes I hung up. I have customers waiting for these items and I'm not having to issue refunds and apologies to my customers which is unacceptable. This company is messing up my reputation that I have worked hard to build because of their unprofessional business practices, misrepresentation and unreliability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
      "208959  Undisclosed Good tires but Forrest told me I could get a discount on them for coming there and them not being there because the truck with them in there broke down and I had to drive 80 both ways 2x to get there and wasted my time but I got cheated out of my discount because forest didn't check me out the second time so y'all owe me some money                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
      "209228  Small closed sound; Seventy Five to return it! I was hoping to get a smaller guitar and with the stores closed I thought I'd try one from Musician's Friend..  I like Yamaha and have a full size, but this 3/4 size just doesn't make it.  Then I was so shocked to find out that UPS wanted 79 to send it back and FedEx 75 --for a 200 guitar.  Maybe it's not fair, but II feel like I've been cheated by Musician's Friend.  I won't be ordering a guitar again online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
      "209392  Durable I loved the easy ride with the wheels--you can handle more than one when needed easily.  I find the multiple zippers cumbersome in that it's hard to tell which is the main one at times.  Would be great if there was better distinction.  The suitcases held up well through two trips by airline however the airline baggage process did manage to rip off the Samsonite emblem but the rest of the suitcase is intact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "216305  Damaged furniture BUYER BEWARE\\nWe purchased this three piece living room set and were so excited.  Unfortunately, there is a five inch damage in the material on top of the center compartment of the loveseat.  Called BJ's online customer service and the representative told me to contact the manufacturer customerservice@margecarson.com because we already received the furniture and it comes with a one year guarantee.  Well guess what Marge Carson Furniture NEVER heard of BJ's Wholesale and claims they did not make that furniture.  Took the model number looked it up on line and it comes up with Global Furniture once again this company NEVER heard of BJ's Wholesale and did not make this furniture.  We called customer service approximately eight times and five of the times never received a call back and was disconnected the other three times.  Called two different stores in my area asking who to contact was put on hold at Fairless Hills, PA store for 45 minutes and when I called back calls were forwarded to a fax machine.  The other store just rang for over two hours off and on and no one in customer service picked up the phone.  I contacted the corporate office and naturally got voice mail.  I am not holding my breath for this individual to get back to me, however I will give the benefit of doubt.  BJ Wholesale FALSE ADVERTISING on furniture products and not even knowing manufacturer and product information is a poor representation on them as a company.  The best part is the worthless WARRANTY.  The other two people that wrote 5 star reviews were very fortunate.  I just hope that there sets last a long time because there is no where to get information or a replacement on this furniture.  On the good note the set is comfortable and nice, but the material does not look very durable.  I am so disappointed in BJ's Wholesale I have been a member for over 20 years and never have I been treated so badly by any companies customer service department.                                                                  \n",

      "218123  It BURNED ME! As quickly as I bought it I had to return it. It has sooo much dimethicones I can't see how it mattifies the skin? I waited 10 mins after application & it was still greasy, never really sunk into the skin & it BURNED MY CHEEKS! My skin felt hot to the touch & really red. I guess it's claims of \"for sensitive skin\" is false advertising.it has WAY too many unnecessary ingredients,  like a book long! Jesus christ. I had to wash my face immediately but its still burning & red.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "220474  Deceptive Sales Technique Tricked by a pop up at the end of placing my order for other items.  It showed the flashlight and said \"FREE\", in big bold letters, if added to your order in the next ?? seconds.  Click here.  I didn't need a flashlight but thought, well if it's free I'll just use it as a stocking stuffer, so I clicked.  I was appalled when I viewed my order confirmation and saw that I had been charged $55.07 for it.  I didn't really need a flashlight, especially a $55 one.  I tried immediately to cancel the order but their email inbox was full and not accepting messages.  I also was unable to get through by telephone, but I kept trying and when I finally got through, it was shipped already.  Of course I can return it for credit, but they will deduct  the shipping cost.  Apparently somewhere on the popup it was clarified that the rush to CLICK NOW was to get free shipping (only).

      "238811  Jacket was never received Eddie Bauer lost a valued customer. I have sworn by Eddie Bauer jackets, but you guys have an awful back end support and customer service team. I ordered a jacket for my husband during Christmas sale in December which showed available online and after 10 days of placing the order, eddie bauer cancelled the order saying the product is not available and cannot be shipped. Now please understand that nor have I only lost all the deals from other competitive out wear companies like North face and Columbia, but have also not received a winter jacket to protect myself. \\n\\nAfter that, I ordered a woman's jacket in January for which the same thing happened, it showed in stocks online and after purchasing they emailed to say its out of stock. \\nPost which, still having the faith in the company, I tried purchasing the jacket again as it showed in stocks for my size and to my disappointment the jacket was shipped to a wrong address. Upon investigation, the courier company returned the jacket to the eddie bauer return facility (still wondering how did they manage to do that). This almost seems like the company does not want the customer to have the jacket.\\n\\nNow I have absolutely lost faith in eddie bauers ability to help me with any service or product. As per ecommerce laws, it's fraudulent to misrepresent that a product is available and then say it's not in stock. After speaking to the customer service team, they would like me to repurchase the jacket at the listed price right away as the size and color of the jacket was rarely available. I was travelling in 5 days and had no patience to go through the whole ordering process and hoping that it would be fulfilled, so I requested a refund for the amount. I had used gift cards worth CAD 159 and the customer service representative confirmed that I would receive the full refund for the product on my credit card. After a few days only part of the amount was refunded and they denied the refund noting that only store credit will be issue      \n",
      "241090  Wanted to love it but....... I researched washers for days before deciding on this machine. \\nMy decision was based on the 5-year warranty, reputation, on-line and Consumer Report reviews and recommendations from friends who loved their Speed Queen machines.   It was replacing a 14 yr. old Whirlpool that had served us well but was no longer repairable.   The machine is solid and has a small footprint which I really like.   I initially loved how it washed but am now 6 months down the road and not impressed.    In addition to already having to call for repair service for a malfunctioning balance ring, I found out from customer service AND the repair tech that the pre-set Normal/Eco cycle (which is pre-set to wash on \"warm\") actually only washes on COLD regardless of what temperature is chosen.  I was shocked and angry because it is misleading.   When I stated to Customer Service that it's basically fraud to show that a cycle is washing on one temp when it's really washing on another regardless of what temperature is chosen, the response was \"The government makes us do it.\"    This alone makes me not want to recommend it to anyone but there are quirks as well.   If I don't put socks and small items in a mesh laundry bag, they tend to \"land\" in the rim during the wash cycle and just get stuck there.   I can't just wash a small load of anything or it goes off-balance during the spin cycle and basically locks up and displays an error message that only clears after it's been unplugged and plugged back in to reset it....at which point it starts all over again.   Sometimes this happens during (what I would consider) a \"normal size\" load.   It seems this machine does best with liquid detergent, not laundry pods.   When I use a laundry pod, I tend to have to add several extra rinses just to get the soap out.   Overall, I regret spending nearly $2,000 on this machine.   Maybe the top loaders are good, but Speed Queen needs to do some work on their front loader.                                                      \n",
      "241469  Stretchy These are more stretchy than most nail stickers, which made it a bit harder to just rip off on the tips of my nails, and use the other half. However, I was able to figure it out, and use them as well as other brands.  I don't care for the Dashing Diva brand, and find them too stiff.  The brands I enjoy are Color Street, the old Sally Hansen (which I can't find anymore), and Incoco.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "245733  Deceptive So, I bought these in-store at the reduced price and stupidly did not look inside the box before I left. Looks like I got a returned \"basement \" item, because there was dirt on the bottoms of the soles and they looked gently worn. Oh well, I thought...I DID just buy them for 25 dollars. Fast forward to me wearing them...such a snug fit in the calf, I have caused Charlie horses trying to remove them! The suction is so strong! Yes, they keep my feet warm and dry, but if I don't take the time to properly and completely pull them up, I get a rub so bad on the back of my lower calf. And I even sized up!

      "246326  Not flattering I thought the shorts would be loose at the hem for a slightly A-line or skort look but it's not. It tapers from the hip down. It deeats the purpose of using relaxed linen and it's not flattering. I ordered red and the blue-white strips. The fabric for the red one is too stiff. The blue-&-white one is much more relaxed and comfortable. But I returned both because they're just not flattering on.\\n\\nP.S. When I ordered them, I didn't know they're final sales because it's not stated besides the price. I was surprised when I saw it on the packaging slip. I called Boden. I was told it's stated in the return policy that any price with \".99\" would be final sales. In the US, this is in deceptive sales preactices territory because no customer would check return policy for each merchandise ordered. \"Final Sale\" is always marked right by the discounted price on website here. Boden is nice enough to make an exception for me. I recommend Boden to make \"Final Sale\" clear on the product page since you're selling to American consumers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "249953  Picture is deceptive. Queen size only has 2 drawers. So far I really enjoy this furniture! My one complaint is that the picture shows seems to show not only the two star age draws on the footboard, but also two on either side for a total of six. That is not the case. It is just two drawers for the queen size bed frame. Since I was expecting there to be six drawers I was very disappointed initially. But I was able to rearrange everything to get all of my stuff to fit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "251077  Beware of ingredients, can cause severe damage I tried this product as directed and at first everything was fine, but after about a month my eyelids became itchy, red, and dry. I stopped using it and these issues went away, and I was not using any other new products so it was obvious this was the culprit. I tried it again a month later and once again the issues started. Curious, I looked up the ingredients and discovered that one of them is a known drug that other companies such as Rodan and Fields are getting sued over- isopropyl cloprostenate. Look it up. I'm actually lucky I didn't suffer worse side effects like so many others have. Buyer beware!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "255072  Not all tubas fit My Willson 3100 BBb tuba is too think from the front action piston valves to the back of the horn for the flap to zip up and close.  See photo.

      "256581  Recomended if used as designed Like most products, the key to this one is to use it for what it's designed for. It's a gun locker. A good one, but nevertheless, it's a locker. This is not a safe and the vast majority of people, including the manufacturer, are not claiming this is designed to be impenetrable and theft-proof. Mounting it under a bed adds another layer of security in that how many people can contort themselves and use tools effectively? More importantly, just how many professional thieves are coming to make a concentrated attack for 1 or 2 guns of unknown value? I purchased this to have ready access to my shotgun while keeping it safe from our child and any typical smash and grab petty thief that's statistically in and out of a house in less than 7 minutes. The Ocean's 11 crew is not coming for my shotgun.

      "257188  Best Improved! I've been a Citi card holder for some time and over the years they have really done a great job of improving both their services and customer service both of which left a lot to be desired. I really enjoy the card benefits and ease with which any issues I may have are handled. More importantly I recently experienced fraudulent purchases and Citi contacted me immediately to advise of their findings/confirm the purchase. Once I informed them I had not made the purchase the card was canceled and I received a new card a week later. That to me is priceless in today's society. So I will continue to be a happy Citi customer!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "257490  No The cards were beautiful , but the envelopes were terrible. I paid extra money for A lined envelope. However, they were stickers that I was supposed to insert myself. The stickers were clearly old and did not rip off properly nor did they stick properly. I sent all my cards out in  regular envelopes, no liner.

The rewards are substantial and the extra perks of car rental insurance and no foreign transaction fees are also fantastic. I have had to dispute a fraudulent charge and their customer service is amazing and it was taken care of in a timely manner combined with professionalism and kindness.

      "261536  Bags sliced up The bags ripped at the top seam. The holes for the drawstrings were off-center so even if they hadn't ripped off, it would still be unusable.

      "262740  Lucky? Not! I will start with one positive - the masks are well sewn, this is where the positive ends.\\nThe design is a bit weird, huge gaps on the sides, not sure how much protection they provide.\\nThe pattern is ok, the fabric is not, rough and too thick, not for CA weather and not for sensitive skin. Also wrinkled almost immediately.\\nFalse advertising and information- at the time I placed my order the images featured masks with the usual LB leaf, then they changed the image to disclose the full brand name. I never buy anything featuring the brand name, I feel like I pay my hard earned money to provide free advertising. If like they say they are working hard to make as many masks as they can, why waste more money and labor to attach this huge brand name label? \\nLastly, it says \"made in LA\" , well mine took 10 days to be delivered to San Diego because they were shipped from Walton, KY!

      "265205  An entertaining story! Chance of a Lifetime by Jude Deveraux and Tara Sheets is the first novel in the Providence Falls series.  This book reminds me of Jude Deveraux's early novels which I just loved (Wishes, A Knight in Shining Armor, Sweet Liar).  I thought the story contained good writing and it moved along at a steady pace. The story has humor, drama, mystery, and, of course, romance.  I liked the characters with my favorite being Liam O'Connor.  He is a thief, a charmer, and a rogue.  I like that Chance of a Lifetime combines the present in Providence Falls with Liam and Cora's tale from 1844.  The parallels between the two time periods was intriguing.  And let us not forget the two heavenly judges determined to keep Liam on task.  I liked the humor in the story as it added lightness and levity.   I enjoyed reading Chance of a Lifetime until I got to the end and realized the story was incomplete.  I must now wait for the next installment in the Providence Falls series to find out the identity of the killer (I have an idea and want to see if I am right) and Liam's fate.  Jude Deveraux and Tara Sheets combine history, romance, mystery, and heavenly intervention into one engaging tale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "267151  You get what you pay for ... or less This grill looks great, but I'm mystified as to why Consumer Reports would recommend this grill.  It is clearly made from shoddy materials and you will spend the price you paid over again within 2 years on replacement parts.  I'm actually questioning whether or not I should continue to trust CR based on them recommending this grill.  I feel ripped off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "268386  Different fabric This is NOT the Saltwater 1/2 Zip, this is a Saltwater PERFORMANCE 1/2 Zip. They switched from a superior Pima cotton to a normal cotton and polyester blend.

      "270479  Sweet Purchased in 2019. Had an issue with motor not supporting above 17mph. Freemans Bridge in Scotia NY did a great job trouble shooting the issue. Ended up replacing head unit. Only bike I have ever owned that receives compliments and people taking pictures of it. Replaced tires with the ones that came on the 6.0. They look better and I'm always riding in fair weather on pavement. The fenders are well made and actually have spacers for wheel clearance. I removed one at each point to fit the larger tire. Bike is well made with attention to detail. I'm pretty big and over 200lbs. Wanted the better specs as well as motor battery set up. Bike is powerful and can climb. It is heavy. The 4.0 looks good if you are lighter and ride the flats. Speaking of flats....I installed self sealing tubes as I did have a flat. Not an easy task without moving computer and bell to turn upside down. Also upgraded to Brooks Saddle and bar end mirror off Amazon. Drilled out grip end to install plug in handle bar. Purchased Rack Time bag on Amazon.  I would recommend this bike for someone who wants to trek long distances without running out of battery. The XT set up is great and the brakes are two piston not four, Price point just dropped. Feel cheated a bit but that's how technology rolls.   \\n\\nPS Mission Control. Use it all the time to record my trips. Not to many adjustments you can do but the data is nice.

      "276088  Great product, unbelievable service !!! 6 stars if I could My wife and I bought our Champion dual fuel inverter generator 2 years ago for our RV. We are mostly dry camping with no shore power so we wanted something to charge our (large) battery bank once a day, it had to be quiet, it had to have clean power for our electronics and it had to have electric start. The Champion ticked all those boxes, plus it was a dual fuel, which meant no gasoline in the back of the SUV. We've never run it on gasoline, just propane so far. Even when it's been sitting a while, it starts on the first crank.\\n\\nIt's a great product and I would have given 5 stars, but given Champion customer service, it deserves 6 stars. We moved house last summer and somehow we lost the propane regulator and hose. I called Champion to order a replacement figuring it was going be be a $200 rip off. I called Champion support, explained what had happened and asked to order a replacement. The service representative took my name and address, did some work on his computer and said \"we're done\". When I asked what the price was, he said they were sending me one free as a courtesy.

      "292843  Everything about this school is great, except its admin. This school will cheat you every way they can, from charging you for printer paper, to increasing tuition and activities fees during covid-19 for no reason other than that they will lose profits if they don't. They're \"non-profit\" while paying administration $400,000+ per year and underpaying faculty to a pathetic degree. They overcharge students for tuition that could be easily matched by a school half this price, and constantly spend ludicrous amounts of money on the places they show touring prospective students, and leave everything else without proper upkeep or maintenance for years on end. They intentionally make it hard to transfer out or get your money back from anything, please read the fine print if you attend this school. Can say this as an active senior during covid, this school is pathetically focused on their bottom line and does not care about you, barely avoids qualifying as a scam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "309538  PRICE GOUGING I have supported & taken Excedrin for as long as I can remember, I would joke that I should be a spokesperson, it's a product that I have always made sure to keep in our home.  That being said, we are on the most part coming together & working to get through this virus as a country, I have been trying to get a bottle for weeks & have watched the prices rise daily on Amazon, today, it is up to $105.95 for a 24 pack, this is OUTRAGEOUS, ILLEGAL & UNACCEPTABLE.  As many have supported your product, this is time for you to stand for your consumers-WILL YOU HELP US & LET US, WHAT WILL YOU DO?

      "312678  Incorrect representation of product This is very disappointing.  The product is not as represented. Does not suit my complexion. Doesn't last more than 30 minutes. Doesn't improve skin as suggested. Should not be a salable item on tsc. Everything about all the items are incorrect as they were represented.  Very disappointing to me that the claims are intentionally deceptive by both host and creator of this product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "314885  Undisclosed When I showed up 15 minutes before closing with a mail in my tire, I was concerned I would not be able to get it fixed in time and unsure how I would get home safely. The entire staff was kind and helpful to me, as no one rushed me and everyone worked efficiently. Prices were fair and I did not feel that I was being ripped off, but rather taken care of and valued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "316744  Nice bike - quality control has declined during pandemic I was very excited to receive this bike - I had done research on bikes that are less expensive than Peloton but offer a good workout and are easy to use with Peloton mobile app. The bike is easy to set - took my husband and I almost a half hour.  Bike is quiet and easy to use. The resistance does not match Peloton but there are conversions available online. After a week of use, the left pedal ripped off the arm crank. The threading where the pedal screwed in was coming completely out. I am assuming that the quality control has decreased some with the pandemic and Schwinn Fitness trying to meet demand. I called customer service and waited 2.5 hours to speak to a representative for a replacement arm crank and pedal and was told it will take up to 60 days to receive. I was able to rig the pedal up so that I can still ride without coming out of the saddle. Disappointing to have to wait so long for replacement parts especially since the bike is less than a month old. I enjoy the bike overall and am eager to receive my replacement parts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

      "324000  Surprise favorite Got this palette directly from CP, thinking I had ordered another. (Duh!). Very fond of my mistake!  This seems a more original take on a 'red family' palette with maroon, purple-ish, peach tones, etc. CP has become iffy, but this palette has even pigmentation, ease of app and blendability. Transition and browbone shades are included, unless you insist on neutrals for that purpose. BBB is actually quite easy to 'read.'  So many combos, both warmer and cooler 'jump out at you' on both the warmer and cooler sides.  Using 'Easy' as a descriptor is a bit deceptive, as this one can go from one and done to a 5+ look.  This is not a one-note 12.  You know, where all the looks are far too similar? BBB does contain plastic glitter, as well as  pigments that are considered not eye safe by the FDA, but ok by EU cosmetics standards. Ulta disclosed this, which is a plus in my book.  Honesty.  Not sure i ever goofed on a palette order before, but I'm enjoying BBB immensely.  Glad that Ulta is offering this, as it is no longer available at CP.  BBB deserves more notice than it received.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "324252  I will never buy another item from NorthStyle I bought a jacket as a Christmas gift. I included the return slip, so the recipient could return it if necessary. She did return it although she was told that it might take months to get the item she exchanged for my gift.. Then I was charged for approximately $16 difference between the item I gave her and her return. As your customer representatives explained your return policy, compared to most business return policies, yours is a very convoluted, confusing, and indefensible return policy. That person also said the recipient should not have included the return slip because anyone can then use it for fraudulent purposes, but the rep never explained why or what a customer is supposed to do with that document. Why include it? \\nTo be clear, your policy has left me holding the bag for over $16.\\nLet me repeat, I will never buy from North Style again. Take my name off your catalog list.

Not good practice from GAP and deceitful in your promotion of this item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "341344  Some Serious Software Control Issues I brought the product as this had integrated Alexa control. But skip song does not work and immediately after playing it stops playing the playlist. Looking online it looks like this problem has been around for many months. Very annoying. Also Sonus is not a total replacement for my PC Speakers … which is not made clear in the sales material.

      "343319  This was a christmas gift for my 100 year old mother. With tax and shipping, I spent $67.38 and you only returned $43.49.  This is a rip-off - I should have gotten $49.98 + $4.41 tax.  I can see you keeping the $12.99 for shipping & processing, but you are not entitled to any more.  I will never do business with you again, and I will go to social media to let everyone know                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "350720  Not 3 Layers Their ok if you get them on sale and just need a mask for the sake of wearing a mask and they are better than no mask BUT... \\n\\nThere is no way there are 3 layers in these masks. Maybe at one time they had 3 and the website hasn't been updated? But I pulled mine that I just bought yesterday apart and it's just 2 layers and the outside printed fabric is quite thin with a lower thread count. The nose wire is also not very affective and doesn't really hold its shape well so the masks are useless for my husband who wears glasses because of the gapping around the nose. \\n\\nDisappointing quality for a GAP product and not what I expected from how they are advertised online. Quite frankly I feel like I was cheated because if says on the website that they are 3 layers and they are not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "354356  Never again from Rack Room! Terrible experience! I purchased two pairs on the bogo offer. I sent an email asking if I needed to return both to receive refund. I just wanted to send one back and order a different color. Which I did. I never received a response. It's been over two weeks. I was still charged full price for the other shoes and received a very minimal refund. I wasn't aware that I needed to return the whole order and re-purchase to receive refund. Very deceptive.

      "365442  DO NOT BUY THIS FLOORING Brought this flooring on an online promotion while renovating our home. Packaging arrived stating Albero why would I question it.....right ? \\nWent away for a night with children so fitters could lay in all areas and came home to ABSOLUTE disappointment!!! the flooring is NOTHING like the images online it does not have the dark grooves as advertised and is a shade of blue grey not a oak grey ! I sent customer services a comparison image of the flooring I was sent and had laid  next to the flooring that was being advertised and they dont seem interested in the fact that they are advertising the product wrong as long as my boards match the \"master board\"  and that the online images are for and I quote \" illustration purposes\" this flooring resemble the Aspen flooring they are advertising not the image they have online for for the Albero . Wickes are not interested in dealing with how there product does not resemble there advertisement and try to put the blame on the customer for not checking this .....I also purchased kitchen floor tiles which funnily enough look EXACTLY like the image online ??? SO is the customer really wrong here? This is  FALSE ADVERTISING and after my feedback I would be very concerned with purchasing online again if the images are not based on actual products .....Very concerning !!\\n\\nOh by the way .....\\n\\n * illustration purposes means use to show that what you are saying/selling is true or to make the meaning clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "367093  Star lights In the picture these look like they will be multi coloured lights....but this is deceptive. They are actually all clear plastic and morph all at once...... so individual star lights are all the same colour all the time, changing en mass! Not what I wanted at all and disappointing.\\n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "373731  DON'T BUY THIS Don't do it. Don't buy this one!!! I applied it and first thing you notice is the alcohol smell. Next it dries quickly but was IMPOSSIBLE to take off. 20+ minutes later I ripped off allll my facial hair. Worst part, now I have a hairier face than I had because I ripped off all the little hairs on my face. Because it ripped off all my hair my skin was red and very irritated. I don't recommend this at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "4547    No I bought these grips about a month ago and initially really liked their feel. Really soft rubber, very grippy, and comfortable. Not too much texture or stuff in the way, and they fit my hands well. It even reduced hand fatigue in comparison to specialized trail grips.\\n\\nHowever after about a month of riding, a few times a week, they're already showing signs of ware on the grip pattern. Additionally the grip ends aren't very durable at all. They ripped off the first time I laid my bike down on a turn.\\n\\nI think these would be good for riders looking for a high level of comfort, aren't too rough on their bikes, or don't mind replacing grips often.

      "13613   Need look into the problem I am so disappointed. This is a replace one, my original one is very loosed, cannot hold the power, but this new, replaced one is the same. I am checked, it is too shallow when plug in, so is very loosed, I have to use something to have it hold in plug in/connection position but still very easy yo lost connection/cord. Since this is the new one but shows the same problem as the original one, my conclusion is that the pot's power slot is not fit with the power cord!!!!!!!! This is a simple thing, but IP did show the design defect. I like the pop, but cannot believe that there is such a simple, but design defect! If other types pops are the same, I am a fraud that I will not buy again - a lot of hassles, sometime during cook, it lost connection, lost the power, even I use something to hold the cord in the place. I use all kind appliances which using electrical and have the power cords, I never even encounter the loosed power cord that cannot hold the connection. I think your tach/design department should take the problem seriously, and solve the problem in the future product, otherwise you will lost the customers. I hate to say so because I like the pop in general, but this is a basic condition - if all functions of the product are excellent, but no power, just would not work.  BTW, I like the IP's services, so I hope it cannot improved and earn my trust again.\\nMindy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "14775   More than just a pillow!! The very first night I received the pillow an armed intruder burst into my bedroom. He pointed a .357 magnum at me and out of share instinct I put the pillow in front of me. I heard 3 gun shots ring out, but to my surprise, not a single 1 penetrated the pillow. This also stunned the burglar and in his moment of bewilderment I swung the pillow at him as hard as I could. It hit him square on his left side and sent him crashing face first into my dresser. Blood spilled from his clearly broken nose as I loaded up for my ensuing  back swing. I don't have the best accuracy swinging this way and caught him on his left knee causing it to buckle backwards in a horrific 90 degree angle. The burglar dropped to floor and the gun toppled from his hand. As he scrambled to regain control of the revolver I hoisted the pillow over my head (this thing weighs more than most sledge hammers) and brought it down squarely on his back, snapping his spinal column. \\n     I had to pay cleaners $500 to get all the blood stains out of the carpet, I was arrested for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and I'm being sued by the burglar for his medical expenses and trauma, but this pillow is so comfortable I sleep as if I don't have a care in the world. \\n4 out 5 stars because it weighs NINE POUNDS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "14835   Online Account Access Locked In an effort to practice social distancing I set up zelle to transfer money from my Chase account to another outside bank account. I made several attempts to get it working because both banks had the same phone and email info. As a result my online access was locked and I received an email to call customer service. Once I called and explained my situation I went through a series of verifications to establish my legitimacy and access was granted and my transaction completed. With all of the fraudulent activity going on I am so grateful for the stringent guidelines Chase took to lock my account and verify that I am the account owner before granting me access again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "15612   Midwayusa ALWAYS Delivers! I am posting this is in response to Erad's unwarranted review. I have ordered 10,000+ factory 2nds and blemished bullets, various calibers, and have always been ecstatic with the value that Midwayusa offers them at. With all the multiple orders I have made on factory 2nds I have came across multiple bullets that I would consider \"out of spec\" even had some packaged with different weights; 143gr eld and 147 eld's for example. That being said, if you ALWAYS follow safe reloading practices, you'll stay safe. Use factory published load data for the exact components being loaded, start at the beginning load charge for powder, etc. When finding a bullet that is 0.001\" over-spec (ie 0.265\" vs 0.264\") implementing these reloading \"Golden Rules\" will ensure you stay safe.  Erad's review is unwarranted because he is way off base accusing Midwayusa of fraud and must be a \"newb\" to reloading if he thinks 0.001\" will cause severe over-pressuer. That is why ANY reloading manual states over and over again to always use a starting load when developing a SAFE load. If Erad was to do that he would learn that the bullets he purchased would work and probably work well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
      "18626   A young lawyer's story of social justice and finding her pla A young lawyer's story of social justice and finding her place in the world.\\nYolanda Vance is a young African American recently graduated lawyer. Yolanda has had to single-mindedly strive and achieve to survive in a world that has left her essentially orphaned.  In her first job as an attorney at a prestigious corporate New York law firm, she is asked to shred documents in the middle of a raid by the FBI. The firm is guilty of securities fraud and Yolanda does the right thing and becomes a whistleblower. She is offered a position with the FBI, which she thinks will be a desk job. To her surprise, Yolanda is sent undercover to infiltrate an eco- and social justice activist group in California, who are taking on a large energy corporation with a defense contract. The activist group is seen as a threat by the FBI, but Yolanda quickly realizes that all is not that it seems and begins to question who the real criminals are.  Yolanda starts as a narrow, focused and, in some ways, naive character who grows and empowers herself throughout the story. A Spy in the Struggle explores a lot of interesting and relevant issues such as how racial, community, environmental and social justice all intersect. Like Yolanda, we, as readers, are led to contemplate and question what we see in our world and investigate what is occurring beneath the surface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "20529   I WOULD BUY THIS PRODUCT ANYTIME, DAY OR ELSE I absolutely LOVE this fragrance!  I have been wearing this scent every sense I found it in Dallas, TX in 1995 on a business trip!  This is my \"signature\" fragrance & I am sorely disappointed that the price has went through the roof!  I know that they discontinued it, but, do you have to price gouge with the remaining stock!  Just awful!  I won't buy it again until the price is reasonable like the rest of the fragrances.  DARN Shame!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
      "21765   Good product but beware of deceptive practices What I purchased is a good product.  The sales staff is deceptive and push you through the process and tell you they cannot do things that they clearly can such as not make you sign up for the optional insurance.  After you get sucked in to getting the insurance you then have to jump through hoops to get the insurance removed.  Customer service is no help as they direct you back to the store.  The store is little help as they don't know what to do and just give you a form to fill out instead of not making you sign up for the insurance to begin with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
      "23801   Frustrating. Frustrating. Wasted a lot  of time trying to use a coupon code and gift certificate at the same time. I got a notification that I would have to call because I tried to enter a code too many times, like I was doing something deceitful.  I was going to buy even more but decided your company does not appreciate paying customers. If I didn't have a gift certificate to use I would have canceled the full order. Will tell friends and family to avoid gifting from your company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "27526   Great Clothes! I am so glad to have discovered Duluth for plus size women! The clothes are comfortable, hearty, and fit incredibly well! \\n\\nMy visits to the stores have always been pleasant until my most recent. I bought a shirt for my Dad and needed to return due to size. I didn't have my receipt, but the shirt still had tags and the adhesive strip. The associate stated he needed to 'look it up,' trying to find when the item was sold. After several minutes of perusing, he stated he found the item and he was refunding me $9.95. I paid $22.50 for this shirt, so he said he would keep looking. A manager finally came over and asked the associate to return the item. It was a very frustrating experience. I don't like to be made to feel as though I'm lying or trying to cheat the system. Still love and recommend Duluth, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

      "38605   Samsung French door ( RF28K9380SR/AA) refrigerator I love the looks and storage of French Door refrigerators, just not happy with the ice maker. The design is flawed by trying to put the ice maker in thr warmer storage area instead of in the freezer portion. The Ice maker freezes up tight. I contact service that comes out, thaws out the ice maker giving me ice for about three months before freezing up again.\\nI have an extended warranty, but they are frustrated. I called Samsung and have had two service technicians attempt to fix it by replacing new parts. First such repair froze up again in 3 months.\\nI am tired of buying ice, and Samsung is silent after filing a BBB complaint. I am considering replacing the unit with another brand or a side-by-side with the ice maker in the freezer side.\\nBottom line: not happy with Samsung support of their product. I would stay away from Samsung products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "40519   Not hydrating I purchased this based off of the amazing reviews and now I feel cheated. Not only does this product not smell good, but it does NOTHING to moisturize hair! I purchased it with the matching shampoo, which overly dried out my hair. I thought maybe the conditioner would make up for it, but nope! The shampoo needs only a very small amount to lather but the conditioner requires HEAPS of it to add even the tiniest bit of moisture back to your hair. I would say the ratio of conditioner to shampoo is 20:1, so it's not exactly cost effective. It smells like drugstore baby shampoo to me, not honey or anything good. The scent was very off putting. The conditioner has ZERO slip and not even handfuls of it will add any slip to it. It almost feels like once you put it on your hair it just disappears. My hair was not soft, moisturized, nor did it smell pleasant after using this. I'm so confused how the ratings on this are so high. If you have dry or curly/wavy hair, stay away from this.

I'm thankful for the fraud protection, but not very happy with having to ship my order my home and hope it's still there by the time get home from work...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
      "45922   Never again This is my first and last time trying this product line. It does not have 10 speeds and it is barely working. I'm so disappointed, I had just made this in store purchase yesterday because they had this specific item its great and most popular item.  I was looking forward to the 10 speeds but it only has one and for something that has the word power in the title of the name it sure has none it is definitely barely working I would not recommend this item to anyone and will not be be purchasing any of this particular brand of products ever again. I definitely feel cheated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
      "47068   Still have not received the main item I ordered I ordered a pallet and a lipgloss. The lipgloss is the only thing I received. I made contact with customer care. It has been 3 weeks and they keep asking me questions as if I am a liar or a theif. I have no pallet and they still haven't made arrangements for me to either get the pallet or my money back.I will NEVER purchase from them again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "47114   FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!! Description states that this is the actual machine to trim nails, however, when I first received it was only a pack of 6 replacement rollers. Called customer service and was told that the correct product would be shipped out. Received the replacement and that too was just the pack of 6 replacement rollers. Never received the actual trimming machine as the description states. I was also charged for the replacement shipment when I was told there would be no charge as I did not receive what was advertised in the description the first time. DO NOT BUY!!

      "64845   I would buy this product again. The Ruger American Rifle is genius in its simplicity and effectiveness.  It is strong, easy to work, and accurate.  The bedding system is solid and well designed.  I own a few of these rifles.  If there was a fly in the ointment, it is its trigger.  It is the typical Glock style trigger marketed to us by Savage, Mossberg, and Ruger to name a few.  All touting how incredible it is.  It's really to keep them south of a lawsuit, and to many who grew up using good triggers from Winchester, Remington, and others, it stinks.  But marketers are good at telling us how red our blue shirt is and getting us to believe it.  So, I replaced mine with a Timney trigger.  And it is sweet sweet.  No take up, just a couple pounds of short pull and it breaks like a trigger should.  I have an old M70 Winchester with a nice \"smithed\" trigger that is perfection.  This Timney trigger comes so close to that right out of the box, that instead of paying smith fees in the future, I'll just install a new Timney.  It is easy to install and, if you know what a real good trigger should feel and perform like, then this is for you.  It makes a very good serviceable rifle into a great rifle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "68293   Money well spent! I absolutely love this!  I bought this for my home office which is an addition to the house and although I have a pellet stove which heats the rest of the house, this room never warmed enough for me.  Now I turn it on and it is so comfy that I want to go sit and do my work!  It is realistic and heats up with the click of the controller.  I was able to put the legs together with a simple screwdriver in 5 minutes!  Shown it to all my family members and everyone says the same thing - looks nice in the office and doesn't look cheap or phony.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "69106   CCat's LOVE these New packaging has both ends closed which makes it impossible to reverse side with out ripping off one end.  Additional, gives less room for cat to scratch.

I do enjoy on some occasions but it's not for you if you are a full glam type of enthusiasts.  its also a brand owned by estee lauder.  I take issues with estee lauder around marketing strategies and ethics but that's a personal decision.  as far as the foundation goes.  its a lovely formula if you are just wanting a daytime and out for a few hours type of foundation.  applying it quick style is sometimes pleasing.  but if you love the process of applying foundation then it's not a fun one. \\n..for reference.....\\nI have dry to combo skin. my shade range is fair/neutral with slightly warm dominance. my concerns are large pores on nose, minimal aging signs like a few fine lines and scarring but I am 38 with a conscience of skin health and a skin care routine that is realistic based on scientific reasoning.....not beauty industry deceptive marketing hypes. I have  sun damage from my skin health ignorance years where I didn't understand the efficacy of caring for my skin.  fyi....everyone with anti aging on the mind should use spf all year around including on the eyes.  no fancy anti aging or eye cream can fight off sun damage like spf topical formulas.  but spf in foundations is unnecessary to hike the prices and isn't adequate enough to protect.  and I am platinum blonde and blue eyes. my family is very diverse and I have very dark black skinned beauty enthusiasts within my circle and very pale white skin family too. so my recommendation is with all that in mind to recommend and purchase foundations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "75136   Enjoyed the book! Rick Renner, author of over 30 books has a new release set for September of 2020. Last Days Survival Guide: A handbook to prepare you for these perilous times.  When the book surprised me on my doorstep this summer and I opened the box my first thoughts were, \"yep this sounds about right.\"  In the middle of the Covid-19 2020 fest of one new stress-causing event after another, a book about survival is indeed a captivating read.  I received this book from Harrison House, @HarrisonHousePublishers as part of the launch team for an honest review.\\n\\nI have a feeling that many now feel that these are the end times, especially with a worldwide pandemic affecting every part of our lives, from how we work, dress, socialize, and even attend worship services.

      "76594   Nessie Plays Hide & Sea-k.com This came out much darker and much more green than the pictures led me to believe. It comes out as a very dark teal. I probably would have known better if I could have bought it in person but as it was during the Pandemic and I was quarantining at home (but also wishing for new Nail colors to play with) I did not see it in person and the online photos are VERY deceptive. Not as glittery as I was hoping for either.

      "79564   Just what I wanted, but a couple of things to know This safe is excellent, overall.  Well built, inside is so nice to protect whatever you put in it, great features and looks good.  My wife is even pleased with the appearance.\\nCouple of things I want to pass on from my experience setting it up...\\n1) It's heavy so get help moving and placing.\\n2) The serial number is on the back of the safe.  IT'S ALSO ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PACKING BOX!  If you have trouble someday getting into your safe, the serial number will allow Heritage Safe to help you back in, via codes or keys.  If someone checking trash removes the serial number from your disposed of box, they might be able to use it to scam codes or keys and get into your safe when your not home.  So, remove the serial number from the outside carton before disposal.\\n3) The 9V battery provided with the safe is poor quality.  Don't even bother to use it.  Put in a high quality 9V with a long shelf life and save yourself a headache later.\\nThat's about it.

      "94490   Color Not As Shown I got this shawl in 'malachite', which the picture shows as a nice dark grey. When i received it, it's actually a dark green.

      "95366   Nice product but........ Unlike many vegetarian 'bites' these aren't pappy but have a good firm texture and a good flavour too. They would have earned an extra star if it was not for the amount of fresh air in the box. The contents would have easily fitted into a box half the size. One can't help but feel ripped off when you open it. I don't really have space in my freezer for boxes of air plus I hate the waste involved in the extra packaging to surround it. (when will manufacturers wake up to the surplus packaging issue?) The only other,thing I can say is that it is quite pricey for the amount that you get in the box. OK fo just  me, but I wouldn't want to have to feed a family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "96764   Works, but velcro on 1 boot ripped off 1st use I like the way this works, but the lowest velcro strap ripped off and tore the the first time I used it overnight in my horse's stall.

      "101409  Almost a Perfect Pack.. Few Issues Need Fixed. The main side pocket is hardly usable when the main compartment is full.. The mesh pocket in the middle back of the pack doesn't stretch hardly at all compared to my Escapist pack, but I do like the stronger fabric on top of the stretch pocket to keep it from tearing.. Not sure why the company didn't put a huge Osprey logo on the center of the pack, as it would look way cooler if they did.\\n\\nMY BIGGEST GRIPE is with the water bottle holders.. They don't stretch near enough for bottles, especially when the pack is full. I have to force a Nalgene bottle into them with the pack off of me - I feel like they're going to rip off the pack and they have almost no stretch to them. The Atmos appears to have larger water bottle pockets and holes, as well as a larger loop to pull on for side loading of the water bottles. It's IMPOSSIBLE for me to use the side loads for water bottles on this pack; I could force a bottle into one with the pack off, but it would be jabbing me in the ribs/side the whole time, and the bottle angles down rather than up to fit in the pocket...\\n\\nThese few things need fixed to make this pack a true 5 Stars and to make me actually happy about it.\\n\\nOther than that, I love the side zipper to get into different depth of the main pack compartment. I also love that it comes with a rain fly - Atmos needs that in the USA version. The bottom compartment for a sleeping bag/bottom pack access is great too. I'd suggest slightly larger hip pockets too.. Something more like belly bag size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

      "108964  Completely disappointed in my ruined bra I was so excited to order this bra. My first brand new ck (I only owned thrifted previously) I thought the brand was a mark of quality. I was wrong. I ordered the largest size available at the time thinking they cared about size inclusivity and body positivity. Also wrong. \\nThe bra fit relatively comfortable yet a bit tight. Then after my first wash/air dry and second wear it completely fell apart at the seam of the band. I felt so cheated out of my hard earned. \\nI'm planning to take my business to a more inclusive brand like TomboyX. To get a product I can hopefully count on. \\nI hope the future of Calvin Klein corrects itself on where it's products are produced, along with the quality of them.

Lying and deceitful is too much to win a sale I'll stick with cheaper more knowledgeable and ethicaly bound auto retailers  see if they block the truth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "127592  Full power 20yr 10mm veteran. I shot it all. 155gr jhp underwood is my do it all round. Self defense, deer, bear defense. NOTHING ELSE comes close when it comes to power and accuracy. I shoot alot of cheap s&b 10mm for proficiency and fun but love to shoot these 155gr underwood fmj rounds here and there because they are cheaper than the jhp ammo and match ballistics and point of aim for le$$. Also it's insanely fast and powerful out of my thureon defense carbine with 2\" groups at 100 yds. In my ruger match champion revolver and and my g40 (oem barrel and 7.25\" KKM barrel) i can make 5 holes touch at 25 yds if shooting off a sandbag. Superb stuff.

      "130034  I got price gouged First, I'd like to say, CTD did a little price gouge on me when I bought these at the beginning of COVID-19. I bought these after adding them to my cart, a week later the price fell to its now normal price. I bought 3, one for myself and 2 as gifts. I tested all 3 before gifting them away. All 3 fed and fired. But I'll be honest I don't like the looks of the quality of the spring. I don't know how it will do under extended load, not just loading it and firing it all the next day. Great for the range, but obviously impractical For a carry item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
      "130897  Excellent product at a good price Purchased this when hand sanitizer became extinct in stores, and SO glad I did.  This is an excellent product.  I love that it's a liquid spray, not a gel.  It dries quickly.  It does not leave a residue or dry out your hands like other sanitizers.   I use this for sanitizing not just my hands, but all kinds of surfaces.  OK, yes... the odor is not exactly pleasant.  If you read some of the Amazon reviews some people say it smells like rotting flesh, poop, vomit, etc.   Those people are just being ridiculous.  The only thing it smells like is ethyl alcohol, which is exactly what it is.  Yes, it's strong, but as soon as it dries the smell is gone.   Not only do I like the product, but I appreciate the fact that Chemical Guys is manufacturing a product that we all need right now and they are selling it at a very reasonable price instead of trying to price gouge like so many others.

      "138395  Deceptive Practices Soured My Experience I ordered an in stock washer/dryer pair on 9/2/20. I should have seen red flags when other retailers said they couldn't fulfill the order for the same pair until 10/18/20. I placed the online order with Conn's, but my debit card transaction locked up the site. A phone call to support essentially said that I wasn't able to make the online order. After hanging up, I selected PayPal, and the transaction went through without issue. I again called customer service, as I wasn't able to select the delivery date for my order. Another red flag? I let the rep know that I was moving into a new house on 10/1/2020, and wanted delivery on that date. I was assured it would not be a problem and a note would be made. Less than a week later, I received an email telling me that the appliances would not be delivered until 10/18/20. I accepted, and called Conn's on 10/16/20 to confirm delivery would be on time and without issue. I was assured they would be.\\nOn 10/18/20, I got an email staying delivery would not be occurring that day. The next available date for delivery was 11/28/20. I contacted customer support to say this was unacceptable. After being transferred through several departments to ask when items would be in stock, I contacted the online orders department again. I was told that one of the two items was not in stock, but the same item in a different color was available. I was told that if I canceled and placed a new order, I could get it for the original sale price paid and within a few days. After placing the online order while the rep stayed on the phone, we found that the new items were not, in fact, in stock. With no other solution, my order had to be canceled for good. Overall, the online orders support was fantastic, but all other aspects of Conn's were very disappointing.                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

      "147401  Decent product, but packaging is deceptive AF. First cuticle balm I've used. Before using this, my cuticles were incredibly dry with many hangnails around it. It does a good job of moisturizing, but the shape is weird. Like a jumbo lipstick. \\n\\nI apply it directly to my cuticles and rub it in with my fingers. Been using it for a few weeks now and I have noticed a difference. I no longer get cracks and dryness around my fingers. Also, I feel like it helped get rid of my hangnails. \\n\\nI recommend applying it at night as it's quite greasy. One point off for powdery old lady smell (I hate unnecessary fragrance in skin products) and another point off for deceptive packaging. The actual product took up about 1/4 of the tube. \\n\\nStill on the hunt for a good cuticle balm, but this one isn't bad for a first time user. Been trying to take better care of my hands. Handwashing is vital especially since Covid hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
      "150064  Not 8ozs! Love French's Yellow Mustard and have been using it for years. However, for the first time today, I needed 3/4 of a cup for a recipe. I opened a brand new 8oz bottle and guess what? There only 3/4 of a cup in the container, NOT 8 ozs!! So we're not getting what we're paying for. Not that it's expensive, but it is false advertising.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Otherwise you will be wasting your time and money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "155920  No contact is not actually available at ACE The product is fine.  Absolutely fine and there is not difference between buying this product from two different sources.  However, I bought this product to try to support my local business and all I wished to do was do it with no contact, however I was forced to have contact with the person to sign for something like $11 worth of material.  I have not had to do that in the past.  I was told that it was because there was credit card theft going on, to which I can only say that a decent thief would probably do better than 4 electrical boxes for their big heist.  All that said, I won't be coming back until after the pandemic.  I'll go find my stuff on amazon or ebay.  It appears that it's safer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
      "156589  Not safe for unsupervised sleeping I registered for this bassinet based on stellar reviews on this website as well as target and amazon and received it as a gift. Nowhere in any of the product details does it include the fact that this is not safe for unsupervised sleeping. I was looking through the Q&A on targets website to determine whether I could buy sheets for this product and came across answers directly from the company that this is not recommended for unsupervised or overnight sleeping. The advertising feels deceptive as it is marketed as being designed for sleep. I tried to write this review on target as well and they did not publish it so I think the positive reviews are likely inflated. Buyer beware.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

      "160295  It's good but I feel a little deceived This item had a hard start for me, I ordered during the COVID issue but wanted to support a friend didn't even think the wait would be extended so long.  Then upon getting the popper, I was pretty sure I got the wrong item, but it ships collapsed!  Looks very small in the HUGE box it was shipped in, but alls well.  Also I found the reason for the wait.  Made in China (not Vietnam - like on site) so I'm sure the delay was in manufacturing and customs (not at US packaging facility like implied on website).   \\nThings got better from there,  on my first pop, I used Orvile Reddenbackers (our standby for consistent popping corn) and no oil/butter  It did a good job!  not too many old maids (shhh) it did exactly what was expected.  The lid did not pop off (saw in other reviews), bowl was VERY hot (so don't plan on using as serving bowl as website shows unless you plan on waiting a while).\\nOverall, getting past the wait & made in China (wish Pampered Chef would buy local), the popper did what it was supposed to do. but giving 3 stars for what I felt was a little deceptive marketing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
      "161978  Never received product! We ordered this product 21 days ago! Nearly a month ago! This was supposed to take 7 to 10 days to receive and we've never received the product. I have not received a refund and I have requested both. I called multiple times and only got through customer service once, after waiting for over an hour! At 1 hour and 18 minutes the lady that finally answered the call (who sounded nice and helpful) disconnected the call. So I got hung up on after an hour and 18 minutes, without her being able to help me at all. I messaged through the BJ's web site that day (a Thursday) and had to wait until the following week to hear back for their 2-3 business day wait period. Apparently it has been re-shipped again through their \"vendor\" but I only received a random tracking number without a way to track it. I have no idea what carrier this was sent through and therefore I have requested a link only to not hear back about that. Do not waste your time/money ordering this mattress!! I had planned on ordering another one but I will not as I am sure I will struggle to even get this mattress or a refund. I suppose we may have to go through our bank to dispute these charges as fraudulent. This has taken so much of my time it is absolutely ridiculous!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
      "162512  Are NOT 3D Compatible They looked like great bindings but were advertised as 3D compatible, so I paid for expedited shipping to get them sooner.  Not only were they NOT 3D compatible, EVO did not refund the expedited shipping when I returned them, even though I would never ever have ordered them had I known they wouldn't fit my old school Burton board.  It's false advertising and poor customer service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Everything was very good, but I was disappointed that the $15 marketing research credit (code DANKEAV1U19B) promised by Julie Genova was not acceptable. Since only 1 promo code is usable at a time, these $15 credits probably rarely get used, except for very small orders, where other promo codes would not apply.

      "171878  Super great breakfast, feels like a cheat! Great breakfast, so tasty when you want something warm. The egg takes more time to heat up, for some reason. I need to heat that seperalety. But I am used to that now and love this item. I add either hot sauce or ketchup or salsa, depending on what kind of mood I woke up in and it never fails-unless you leave it in the microwave too long or not enough, that is.

      "173149  The smell is a big nope for me I bought these on a whim because I love pacifica products (usually.. not universally, though).  I bought this one with the moisturizing one as well, both in travel size to test them.  I kind of had them in mind for my \"cheat\" days when I don't feel like doing my full skincare routine but I don't want to go to bed having done nothing.  I'll start with what I don't like.  The smell is so overpowering and sweet.  The fragrance is like an orange creamsicle, which maybe you like, but I don't want my face smelling like that.  Furthermore, fragranced skincare products can cause irritation, but I have used some scented products on my face without consequence, so I gave this one a try.  Unfortunately, I can't get past the smell.  The pros of this product is that the formulation is very clean, it's vegan and cruelty free, and it wasn't all that irritating, considering it has glycolic acid in it.  This is probably because of the addition of things like aloe.  If you get this product, start out with the 10 piece travel size so you can make sure you can tolerate the smell.  Once you wipe these on your skin, your face wont stop smelling like orange-vanilla, so make sure you like it before buying the full pack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "182781  Good product with deceptive packaging I bought this product on a lark. I struggle with dark, large under eye circles and I'm always on the lookout for the next, best thing. Creams, serums, concealers, whatever. This product seems to have a slight blurring, reflective quality that does lesson the dark appearance. It is moisturizing, even a tiny bit greasy, but not enough to be a deal breaker. I think if you only have slight darkness under your eyes, this cream alone could be enough for you. In my case, I still need concealer. To my surprise, the product still works under concealer, making it more effective. My main complaint is the packaging. When I first opened the container, I was angry and sure that I had just bought a used product! It wasn't until I read reviews that I realized that the little jar is about 80% empty by design. Who thought that was a good idea? When I buy expensive, high-end products I expect to be pleased-- even delighted-- with the packaging. It's part of the overall experience and I suspect one of the reasons many of us indulge in pricey skin care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "191259  Extra Large? These masks are basically standard sized - slightly wider across the face but not as tall from nose to chin. They are by no means an extra large mask. i would have returned them if they were eligible for return. Bought 4 masks, feel like I was cheated out of $40 by DXL who represents their products as sized for larger men (trust me I have shopped at DXL and at their predecessor).  Have given these masks to family members since they were useless to me. The question is what is DXL going to to to make this right and retain me as a customer? I will update this in 1 week to let the public know what has transpired and if DXL does the right thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
      "192388  Stay away I bought this to replace a really old fitbit zip and I was most interested in the sleep stats.  One day I felt my wrist getting hot and when I took off the watch there was a small eraser sized burn mark.  Apparently there have been lawsuits against fitbit for these wrist burns. Luckily mine happened during the 30 day return window                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "193896  The glitter ruined it for me. I didn't realize this was a glitter puzzle because the picture shown on the website is of the original artwork, minus the glitter. That was a little deceptive. Read the title/description carefully. The glitter covers up the detail and beauty of the original picture and makes the puzzle more difficult. This was my first Bits and Pieces puzzle. I enjoyed the unique puzzle pieces, but the glitter was a huge disappointment. Minus 3 stars just because of the glitter. Otherwise, I would have given 5. I look forward to doing another Bits and Pieces puzzle because I loved the unique shapes and good quality; but NO glitter for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

      "207134  NEVER RECEIVED, STILL SHOWS PROCESSING I have been using Vistaprint for many years. Recently I engaged the services of their company Promotique beginning in April of this year. Since that time I have placed 7 different orders totaling $427.88. I have had issues with every single order I have placed with their Promotique company starting with the first order where I was sent a defective item. This order was made on April 7th and did not receive my item until May 4th, weeks after the promised delivery date. On another order they screwed up, I was promised 15% off my next order and never received that promised discount. Now I ordered several items on June 6th and received all those items with the exception of two more than a week ago and those two remaining shirts from that order remain \"processing\" when the promised deliver date is tomorrow. Meanwhile, two days ago I placed an order for the exact same shirt and it already shows that order for the same item made two days ago as shipped, yet these two others from my June 6 order remain processing. I called their customer service dept on June 21st and advised the representative I intended to file a complaint with the BBB and in retaliation, was just put on hold and left there. After 17 minutes I hung up. I have customers waiting for these items and I'm not having to issue refunds and apologies to my customers which is unacceptable. This company is messing up my reputation that I have worked hard to build because of their unprofessional business practices, misrepresentation and unreliability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
      "208959  Undisclosed Good tires but Forrest told me I could get a discount on them for coming there and them not being there because the truck with them in there broke down and I had to drive 80 both ways 2x to get there and wasted my time but I got cheated out of my discount because forest didn't check me out the second time so y'all owe me some money                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
      "209228  Small closed sound; Seventy Five to return it! I was hoping to get a smaller guitar and with the stores closed I thought I'd try one from Musician's Friend..  I like Yamaha and have a full size, but this 3/4 size just doesn't make it.  Then I was so shocked to find out that UPS wanted 79 to send it back and FedEx 75 --for a 200 guitar.  Maybe it's not fair, but II feel like I've been cheated by Musician's Friend.  I won't be ordering a guitar again online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
      "209392  Durable I loved the easy ride with the wheels--you can handle more than one when needed easily.  I find the multiple zippers cumbersome in that it's hard to tell which is the main one at times.  Would be great if there was better distinction.  The suitcases held up well through two trips by airline however the airline baggage process did manage to rip off the Samsonite emblem but the rest of the suitcase is intact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "216305  Damaged furniture BUYER BEWARE\\nWe purchased this three piece living room set and were so excited.  Unfortunately, there is a five inch damage in the material on top of the center compartment of the loveseat.  Called BJ's online customer service and the representative told me to contact the manufacturer customerservice@margecarson.com because we already received the furniture and it comes with a one year guarantee.  Well guess what Marge Carson Furniture NEVER heard of BJ's Wholesale and claims they did not make that furniture.  Took the model number looked it up on line and it comes up with Global Furniture once again this company NEVER heard of BJ's Wholesale and did not make this furniture.  We called customer service approximately eight times and five of the times never received a call back and was disconnected the other three times.  Called two different stores in my area asking who to contact was put on hold at Fairless Hills, PA store for 45 minutes and when I called back calls were forwarded to a fax machine.  The other store just rang for over two hours off and on and no one in customer service picked up the phone.  I contacted the corporate office and naturally got voice mail.  I am not holding my breath for this individual to get back to me, however I will give the benefit of doubt.  BJ Wholesale FALSE ADVERTISING on furniture products and not even knowing manufacturer and product information is a poor representation on them as a company.  The best part is the worthless WARRANTY.  The other two people that wrote 5 star reviews were very fortunate.  I just hope that there sets last a long time because there is no where to get information or a replacement on this furniture.  On the good note the set is comfortable and nice, but the material does not look very durable.  I am so disappointed in BJ's Wholesale I have been a member for over 20 years and never have I been treated so badly by any companies customer service department.                                                                  \n",

      "218123  It BURNED ME! As quickly as I bought it I had to return it. It has sooo much dimethicones I can't see how it mattifies the skin? I waited 10 mins after application & it was still greasy, never really sunk into the skin & it BURNED MY CHEEKS! My skin felt hot to the touch & really red. I guess it's claims of \"for sensitive skin\" is false advertising.it has WAY too many unnecessary ingredients,  like a book long! Jesus christ. I had to wash my face immediately but its still burning & red.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
      "220474  Deceptive Sales Technique Tricked by a pop up at the end of placing my order for other items.  It showed the flashlight and said \"FREE\", in big bold letters, if added to your order in the next ?? seconds.  Click here.  I didn't need a flashlight but thought, well if it's free I'll just use it as a stocking stuffer, so I clicked.  I was appalled when I viewed my order confirmation and saw that I had been charged $55.07 for it.  I didn't really need a flashlight, especially a $55 one.  I tried immediately to cancel the order but their email inbox was full and not accepting messages.  I also was unable to get through by telephone, but I kept trying and when I finally got through, it was shipped already.  Of course I can return it for credit, but they will deduct  the shipping cost.  Apparently somewhere on the popup it was clarified that the rush to CLICK NOW was to get free shipping (only).

      "238811  Jacket was never received Eddie Bauer lost a valued customer. I have sworn by Eddie Bauer jackets, but you guys have an awful back end support and customer service team. I ordered a jacket for my husband during Christmas sale in December which showed available online and after 10 days of placing the order, eddie bauer cancelled the order saying the product is not available and cannot be shipped. Now please understand that nor have I only lost all the deals from other competitive out wear companies like North face and Columbia, but have also not received a winter jacket to protect myself. \\n\\nAfter that, I ordered a woman's jacket in January for which the same thing happened, it showed in stocks online and after purchasing they emailed to say its out of stock. \\nPost which, still having the faith in the company, I tried purchasing the jacket again as it showed in stocks for my size and to my disappointment the jacket was shipped to a wrong address. Upon investigation, the courier company returned the jacket to the eddie bauer return facility (still wondering how did they manage to do that). This almost seems like the company does not want the customer to have the jacket.\\n\\nNow I have absolutely lost faith in eddie bauers ability to help me with any service or product. As per ecommerce laws, it's fraudulent to misrepresent that a product is available and then say it's not in stock. After speaking to the customer service team, they would like me to repurchase the jacket at the listed price right away as the size and color of the jacket was rarely available. I was travelling in 5 days and had no patience to go through the whole ordering process and hoping that it would be fulfilled, so I requested a refund for the amount. I had used gift cards worth CAD 159 and the customer service representative confirmed that I would receive the full refund for the product on my credit card. After a few days only part of the amount was refunded and they denied the refund noting that only store credit will be issue      \n",
      "241090  Wanted to love it but....... I researched washers for days before deciding on this machine. \\nMy decision was based on the 5-year warranty, reputation, on-line and Consumer Report reviews and recommendations from friends who loved their Speed Queen machines.   It was replacing a 14 yr. old Whirlpool that had served us well but was no longer repairable.   The machine is solid and has a small footprint which I really like.   I initially loved how it washed but am now 6 months down the road and not impressed.    In addition to already having to call for repair service for a malfunctioning balance ring, I found out from customer service AND the repair tech that the pre-set Normal/Eco cycle (which is pre-set to wash on \"warm\") actually only washes on COLD regardless of what temperature is chosen.  I was shocked and angry because it is misleading.   When I stated to Customer Service that it's basically fraud to show that a cycle is washing on one temp when it's really washing on another regardless of what temperature is chosen, the response was \"The government makes us do it.\"    This alone makes me not want to recommend it to anyone but there are quirks as well.   If I don't put socks and small items in a mesh laundry bag, they tend to \"land\" in the rim during the wash cycle and just get stuck there.   I can't just wash a small load of anything or it goes off-balance during the spin cycle and basically locks up and displays an error message that only clears after it's been unplugged and plugged back in to reset it....at which point it starts all over again.   Sometimes this happens during (what I would consider) a \"normal size\" load.   It seems this machine does best with liquid detergent, not laundry pods.   When I use a laundry pod, I tend to have to add several extra rinses just to get the soap out.   Overall, I regret spending nearly $2,000 on this machine.   Maybe the top loaders are good, but Speed Queen needs to do some work on their front loader.                                                      \n",
      "241469  Stretchy These are more stretchy than most nail stickers, which made it a bit harder to just rip off on the tips of my nails, and use the other half. However, I was able to figure it out, and use them as well as other brands.  I don't care for the Dashing Diva brand, and find them too stiff.  The brands I enjoy are Color Street, the old Sally Hansen (which I can't find anymore), and Incoco.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "245733  Deceptive So, I bought these in-store at the reduced price and stupidly did not look inside the box before I left. Looks like I got a returned \"basement \" item, because there was dirt on the bottoms of the soles and they looked gently worn. Oh well, I thought...I DID just buy them for 25 dollars. Fast forward to me wearing them...such a snug fit in the calf, I have caused Charlie horses trying to remove them! The suction is so strong! Yes, they keep my feet warm and dry, but if I don't take the time to properly and completely pull them up, I get a rub so bad on the back of my lower calf. And I even sized up!

      "246326  Not flattering I thought the shorts would be loose at the hem for a slightly A-line or skort look but it's not. It tapers from the hip down. It deeats the purpose of using relaxed linen and it's not flattering. I ordered red and the blue-white strips. The fabric for the red one is too stiff. The blue-&-white one is much more relaxed and comfortable. But I returned both because they're just not flattering on.\\n\\nP.S. When I ordered them, I didn't know they're final sales because it's not stated besides the price. I was surprised when I saw it on the packaging slip. I called Boden. I was told it's stated in the return policy that any price with \".99\" would be final sales. In the US, this is in deceptive sales preactices territory because no customer would check return policy for each merchandise ordered. \"Final Sale\" is always marked right by the discounted price on website here. Boden is nice enough to make an exception for me. I recommend Boden to make \"Final Sale\" clear on the product page since you're selling to American consumers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "249953  Picture is deceptive. Queen size only has 2 drawers. So far I really enjoy this furniture! My one complaint is that the picture shows seems to show not only the two star age draws on the footboard, but also two on either side for a total of six. That is not the case. It is just two drawers for the queen size bed frame. Since I was expecting there to be six drawers I was very disappointed initially. But I was able to rearrange everything to get all of my stuff to fit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "251077  Beware of ingredients, can cause severe damage I tried this product as directed and at first everything was fine, but after about a month my eyelids became itchy, red, and dry. I stopped using it and these issues went away, and I was not using any other new products so it was obvious this was the culprit. I tried it again a month later and once again the issues started. Curious, I looked up the ingredients and discovered that one of them is a known drug that other companies such as Rodan and Fields are getting sued over- isopropyl cloprostenate. Look it up. I'm actually lucky I didn't suffer worse side effects like so many others have. Buyer beware!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "255072  Not all tubas fit My Willson 3100 BBb tuba is too think from the front action piston valves to the back of the horn for the flap to zip up and close.  See photo.

      "256581  Recomended if used as designed Like most products, the key to this one is to use it for what it's designed for. It's a gun locker. A good one, but nevertheless, it's a locker. This is not a safe and the vast majority of people, including the manufacturer, are not claiming this is designed to be impenetrable and theft-proof. Mounting it under a bed adds another layer of security in that how many people can contort themselves and use tools effectively? More importantly, just how many professional thieves are coming to make a concentrated attack for 1 or 2 guns of unknown value? I purchased this to have ready access to my shotgun while keeping it safe from our child and any typical smash and grab petty thief that's statistically in and out of a house in less than 7 minutes. The Ocean's 11 crew is not coming for my shotgun.

      "257188  Best Improved! I've been a Citi card holder for some time and over the years they have really done a great job of improving both their services and customer service both of which left a lot to be desired. I really enjoy the card benefits and ease with which any issues I may have are handled. More importantly I recently experienced fraudulent purchases and Citi contacted me immediately to advise of their findings/confirm the purchase. Once I informed them I had not made the purchase the card was canceled and I received a new card a week later. That to me is priceless in today's society. So I will continue to be a happy Citi customer!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "257490  No The cards were beautiful , but the envelopes were terrible. I paid extra money for A lined envelope. However, they were stickers that I was supposed to insert myself. The stickers were clearly old and did not rip off properly nor did they stick properly. I sent all my cards out in  regular envelopes, no liner.

The rewards are substantial and the extra perks of car rental insurance and no foreign transaction fees are also fantastic. I have had to dispute a fraudulent charge and their customer service is amazing and it was taken care of in a timely manner combined with professionalism and kindness.

      "261536  Bags sliced up The bags ripped at the top seam. The holes for the drawstrings were off-center so even if they hadn't ripped off, it would still be unusable.

      "262740  Lucky? Not! I will start with one positive - the masks are well sewn, this is where the positive ends.\\nThe design is a bit weird, huge gaps on the sides, not sure how much protection they provide.\\nThe pattern is ok, the fabric is not, rough and too thick, not for CA weather and not for sensitive skin. Also wrinkled almost immediately.\\nFalse advertising and information- at the time I placed my order the images featured masks with the usual LB leaf, then they changed the image to disclose the full brand name. I never buy anything featuring the brand name, I feel like I pay my hard earned money to provide free advertising. If like they say they are working hard to make as many masks as they can, why waste more money and labor to attach this huge brand name label? \\nLastly, it says \"made in LA\" , well mine took 10 days to be delivered to San Diego because they were shipped from Walton, KY!

      "265205  An entertaining story! Chance of a Lifetime by Jude Deveraux and Tara Sheets is the first novel in the Providence Falls series.  This book reminds me of Jude Deveraux's early novels which I just loved (Wishes, A Knight in Shining Armor, Sweet Liar).  I thought the story contained good writing and it moved along at a steady pace. The story has humor, drama, mystery, and, of course, romance.  I liked the characters with my favorite being Liam O'Connor.  He is a thief, a charmer, and a rogue.  I like that Chance of a Lifetime combines the present in Providence Falls with Liam and Cora's tale from 1844.  The parallels between the two time periods was intriguing.  And let us not forget the two heavenly judges determined to keep Liam on task.  I liked the humor in the story as it added lightness and levity.   I enjoyed reading Chance of a Lifetime until I got to the end and realized the story was incomplete.  I must now wait for the next installment in the Providence Falls series to find out the identity of the killer (I have an idea and want to see if I am right) and Liam's fate.  Jude Deveraux and Tara Sheets combine history, romance, mystery, and heavenly intervention into one engaging tale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "267151  You get what you pay for ... or less This grill looks great, but I'm mystified as to why Consumer Reports would recommend this grill.  It is clearly made from shoddy materials and you will spend the price you paid over again within 2 years on replacement parts.  I'm actually questioning whether or not I should continue to trust CR based on them recommending this grill.  I feel ripped off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "268386  Different fabric This is NOT the Saltwater 1/2 Zip, this is a Saltwater PERFORMANCE 1/2 Zip. They switched from a superior Pima cotton to a normal cotton and polyester blend.

      "270479  Sweet Purchased in 2019. Had an issue with motor not supporting above 17mph. Freemans Bridge in Scotia NY did a great job trouble shooting the issue. Ended up replacing head unit. Only bike I have ever owned that receives compliments and people taking pictures of it. Replaced tires with the ones that came on the 6.0. They look better and I'm always riding in fair weather on pavement. The fenders are well made and actually have spacers for wheel clearance. I removed one at each point to fit the larger tire. Bike is well made with attention to detail. I'm pretty big and over 200lbs. Wanted the better specs as well as motor battery set up. Bike is powerful and can climb. It is heavy. The 4.0 looks good if you are lighter and ride the flats. Speaking of flats....I installed self sealing tubes as I did have a flat. Not an easy task without moving computer and bell to turn upside down. Also upgraded to Brooks Saddle and bar end mirror off Amazon. Drilled out grip end to install plug in handle bar. Purchased Rack Time bag on Amazon.  I would recommend this bike for someone who wants to trek long distances without running out of battery. The XT set up is great and the brakes are two piston not four, Price point just dropped. Feel cheated a bit but that's how technology rolls.   \\n\\nPS Mission Control. Use it all the time to record my trips. Not to many adjustments you can do but the data is nice.

      "276088  Great product, unbelievable service !!! 6 stars if I could My wife and I bought our Champion dual fuel inverter generator 2 years ago for our RV. We are mostly dry camping with no shore power so we wanted something to charge our (large) battery bank once a day, it had to be quiet, it had to have clean power for our electronics and it had to have electric start. The Champion ticked all those boxes, plus it was a dual fuel, which meant no gasoline in the back of the SUV. We've never run it on gasoline, just propane so far. Even when it's been sitting a while, it starts on the first crank.\\n\\nIt's a great product and I would have given 5 stars, but given Champion customer service, it deserves 6 stars. We moved house last summer and somehow we lost the propane regulator and hose. I called Champion to order a replacement figuring it was going be be a $200 rip off. I called Champion support, explained what had happened and asked to order a replacement. The service representative took my name and address, did some work on his computer and said \"we're done\". When I asked what the price was, he said they were sending me one free as a courtesy.

      "292843  Everything about this school is great, except its admin. This school will cheat you every way they can, from charging you for printer paper, to increasing tuition and activities fees during covid-19 for no reason other than that they will lose profits if they don't. They're \"non-profit\" while paying administration $400,000+ per year and underpaying faculty to a pathetic degree. They overcharge students for tuition that could be easily matched by a school half this price, and constantly spend ludicrous amounts of money on the places they show touring prospective students, and leave everything else without proper upkeep or maintenance for years on end. They intentionally make it hard to transfer out or get your money back from anything, please read the fine print if you attend this school. Can say this as an active senior during covid, this school is pathetically focused on their bottom line and does not care about you, barely avoids qualifying as a scam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "309538  PRICE GOUGING I have supported & taken Excedrin for as long as I can remember, I would joke that I should be a spokesperson, it's a product that I have always made sure to keep in our home.  That being said, we are on the most part coming together & working to get through this virus as a country, I have been trying to get a bottle for weeks & have watched the prices rise daily on Amazon, today, it is up to $105.95 for a 24 pack, this is OUTRAGEOUS, ILLEGAL & UNACCEPTABLE.  As many have supported your product, this is time for you to stand for your consumers-WILL YOU HELP US & LET US, WHAT WILL YOU DO?

      "312678  Incorrect representation of product This is very disappointing.  The product is not as represented. Does not suit my complexion. Doesn't last more than 30 minutes. Doesn't improve skin as suggested. Should not be a salable item on tsc. Everything about all the items are incorrect as they were represented.  Very disappointing to me that the claims are intentionally deceptive by both host and creator of this product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "314885  Undisclosed When I showed up 15 minutes before closing with a mail in my tire, I was concerned I would not be able to get it fixed in time and unsure how I would get home safely. The entire staff was kind and helpful to me, as no one rushed me and everyone worked efficiently. Prices were fair and I did not feel that I was being ripped off, but rather taken care of and valued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "316744  Nice bike - quality control has declined during pandemic I was very excited to receive this bike - I had done research on bikes that are less expensive than Peloton but offer a good workout and are easy to use with Peloton mobile app. The bike is easy to set - took my husband and I almost a half hour.  Bike is quiet and easy to use. The resistance does not match Peloton but there are conversions available online. After a week of use, the left pedal ripped off the arm crank. The threading where the pedal screwed in was coming completely out. I am assuming that the quality control has decreased some with the pandemic and Schwinn Fitness trying to meet demand. I called customer service and waited 2.5 hours to speak to a representative for a replacement arm crank and pedal and was told it will take up to 60 days to receive. I was able to rig the pedal up so that I can still ride without coming out of the saddle. Disappointing to have to wait so long for replacement parts especially since the bike is less than a month old. I enjoy the bike overall and am eager to receive my replacement parts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

      "324000  Surprise favorite Got this palette directly from CP, thinking I had ordered another. (Duh!). Very fond of my mistake!  This seems a more original take on a 'red family' palette with maroon, purple-ish, peach tones, etc. CP has become iffy, but this palette has even pigmentation, ease of app and blendability. Transition and browbone shades are included, unless you insist on neutrals for that purpose. BBB is actually quite easy to 'read.'  So many combos, both warmer and cooler 'jump out at you' on both the warmer and cooler sides.  Using 'Easy' as a descriptor is a bit deceptive, as this one can go from one and done to a 5+ look.  This is not a one-note 12.  You know, where all the looks are far too similar? BBB does contain plastic glitter, as well as  pigments that are considered not eye safe by the FDA, but ok by EU cosmetics standards. Ulta disclosed this, which is a plus in my book.  Honesty.  Not sure i ever goofed on a palette order before, but I'm enjoying BBB immensely.  Glad that Ulta is offering this, as it is no longer available at CP.  BBB deserves more notice than it received.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
      "324252  I will never buy another item from NorthStyle I bought a jacket as a Christmas gift. I included the return slip, so the recipient could return it if necessary. She did return it although she was told that it might take months to get the item she exchanged for my gift.. Then I was charged for approximately $16 difference between the item I gave her and her return. As your customer representatives explained your return policy, compared to most business return policies, yours is a very convoluted, confusing, and indefensible return policy. That person also said the recipient should not have included the return slip because anyone can then use it for fraudulent purposes, but the rep never explained why or what a customer is supposed to do with that document. Why include it? \\nTo be clear, your policy has left me holding the bag for over $16.\\nLet me repeat, I will never buy from North Style again. Take my name off your catalog list.

Not good practice from GAP and deceitful in your promotion of this item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "341344  Some Serious Software Control Issues I brought the product as this had integrated Alexa control. But skip song does not work and immediately after playing it stops playing the playlist. Looking online it looks like this problem has been around for many months. Very annoying. Also Sonus is not a total replacement for my PC Speakers … which is not made clear in the sales material.

      "343319  This was a christmas gift for my 100 year old mother. With tax and shipping, I spent $67.38 and you only returned $43.49.  This is a rip-off - I should have gotten $49.98 + $4.41 tax.  I can see you keeping the $12.99 for shipping & processing, but you are not entitled to any more.  I will never do business with you again, and I will go to social media to let everyone know                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "350720  Not 3 Layers Their ok if you get them on sale and just need a mask for the sake of wearing a mask and they are better than no mask BUT... \\n\\nThere is no way there are 3 layers in these masks. Maybe at one time they had 3 and the website hasn't been updated? But I pulled mine that I just bought yesterday apart and it's just 2 layers and the outside printed fabric is quite thin with a lower thread count. The nose wire is also not very affective and doesn't really hold its shape well so the masks are useless for my husband who wears glasses because of the gapping around the nose. \\n\\nDisappointing quality for a GAP product and not what I expected from how they are advertised online. Quite frankly I feel like I was cheated because if says on the website that they are 3 layers and they are not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "354356  Never again from Rack Room! Terrible experience! I purchased two pairs on the bogo offer. I sent an email asking if I needed to return both to receive refund. I just wanted to send one back and order a different color. Which I did. I never received a response. It's been over two weeks. I was still charged full price for the other shoes and received a very minimal refund. I wasn't aware that I needed to return the whole order and re-purchase to receive refund. Very deceptive.

      "365442  DO NOT BUY THIS FLOORING Brought this flooring on an online promotion while renovating our home. Packaging arrived stating Albero why would I question it.....right ? \\nWent away for a night with children so fitters could lay in all areas and came home to ABSOLUTE disappointment!!! the flooring is NOTHING like the images online it does not have the dark grooves as advertised and is a shade of blue grey not a oak grey ! I sent customer services a comparison image of the flooring I was sent and had laid  next to the flooring that was being advertised and they dont seem interested in the fact that they are advertising the product wrong as long as my boards match the \"master board\"  and that the online images are for and I quote \" illustration purposes\" this flooring resemble the Aspen flooring they are advertising not the image they have online for for the Albero . Wickes are not interested in dealing with how there product does not resemble there advertisement and try to put the blame on the customer for not checking this .....I also purchased kitchen floor tiles which funnily enough look EXACTLY like the image online ??? SO is the customer really wrong here? This is  FALSE ADVERTISING and after my feedback I would be very concerned with purchasing online again if the images are not based on actual products .....Very concerning !!\\n\\nOh by the way .....\\n\\n * illustration purposes means use to show that what you are saying/selling is true or to make the meaning clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "367093  Star lights In the picture these look like they will be multi coloured lights....but this is deceptive. They are actually all clear plastic and morph all at once...... so individual star lights are all the same colour all the time, changing en mass! Not what I wanted at all and disappointing.\\n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "373731  DON'T BUY THIS Don't do it. Don't buy this one!!! I applied it and first thing you notice is the alcohol smell. Next it dries quickly but was IMPOSSIBLE to take off. 20+ minutes later I ripped off allll my facial hair.
