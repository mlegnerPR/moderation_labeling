      "393    Product took 4 weeks to arrive with no updates or response to emails. When the Nike trainers finally arrived at the Royal Mail pick up point they were now being offered at 50% cheaper directly from Nike. JD offered no price match so they had to be returned the same day! A 25% discount was offered off my next purchase £100 (£25 minimum) but this was nowhere near the £100 saving from Nike! Such a shame as JD are normally so good on service and pricing.

Came in the damaged box but packed very well and nothing were damaged inside.\\nProblem- all part came unnamed as A, B, C...Tried to call for support- never receive call back... spent some time to figure it out... luckily my husband and I had some experience to put furniture together, but no excuse for the company to send all parts with out labels. I placed it in the mud room and will move it to the garage as an utility cabinet in the future                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "953    This fabric is nice and soft, feels high quality.  The manufacturer sewed the front placket and hems beautifully so they don't itch.  But they did not do this on the armholes or side seams, thus being scratchy.  Also, the sizing is for ALOT of shrinkage.  I have washed once and the pjs shrank about half as much as they need to to be true to size.  We will see what the next washing does.  I hope it shrinks enough, as these are basically very nice pj's!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "1371   I enjoy these cards, but, when I'm given envelopes for a card half the size of the 5x7 cards I ordered, it is an issue. In addition, when I tried to contact customer service, the wait time and hours are not user friendly. Shutterfly needs to ensure they are providing accurately sized envelopes since they apparently carry 5x7 sized envelopes with sealed bottoms to only  fit Smaller cards. The customer would only notice when going to stuff the envelopes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

      "3194   I like this product but variation in quality is frustrating.  Sometimes light in color (fresh) and sometimes dark/orangy ( older and more acidic).

      "3747   If you're looking for a jacket that can do it all, this might be it!\\n\\nI've taken this out for two tours (about 5 miles total each). As someone that usually runs really hot, I've found all the vents on this jacket to be lifesaving. There's two chest vents + underarm vents - right at my core where I hold a lot of weight. Easy to unzip the chest vents on the go. The inside pockets fit my skins with ease for quick laps. Keeps me cool on the climb up and toasty on the descent.\\n\\nI'm usually a sch-medium (in between a small and medium), but found the small to be the perfect fit. The cuffs have a little elasticity to them too which is great for keeping snow out.\\n\\nMy one complaint is that the collar is pretty high - zipped up it covers my nose. This is great when the weather isn't ideal, but hard when I'm just trying to keep my ears warm in mild weather - makes breathing a bit difficult.\\n\\nAll in all, it's a well-rounded jacket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "3792   I got it to glow in the bath water! The room needs to be completely pitch black, and it will only be a glimmer of light, but it actually did work in my bath.

      "4352   I ordered an all blue color jacket. If the all blue is what shows up, I will be happy. The jacket has not yet arrived as of this entry (Friday, 01/08/2021). If the blue/maroon is what arrives I will have to send it back. I don't appreciate a merchant doing substitution. At this date, I'm just waiting for a jacket to arrive. They are a great jacket that will keep you warm in subzero weather. The old one I have at present is wearing out, pocket threads are pulling out with no way to repair them. With the nice thick fleece lining one can't get a needle throuh to sew the pocket tight to the shell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
      "4378   I ordered the same size as I do in Lee jeans and they appear to be a size smaller than what I expected.  They are advertised as \"Relaxed Fit\" but if not for the stretch denim, they would be too tight.  They were comfortable enough after I got them zipped up, but they are quite snug.  Since other reviewers said they were true to size, I have to assume they were mislabeled?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "6537   A lovely looking shoe, unfortunately it was too small so I would suggest buying one size up from you usual.\\nThis was made worse by the fact that it was ordered on 20/12/20 and arrived 05/01/21.

      "6637   I ordered a 7.5 and my shoes arrived without a shoe box but in a baggy. The tags were off the shoe. The shoes were a six 6! The shoes looked like a return. The shoes do look cute though but I sent mine back. Hopefully, they send me the right size and in an addidas shoebox.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

      "8884   I was very excited to try the Company Cotton Percale flat sheet. Once I opened the sheet, I could immediately feel the difference between this sheet and the sheets that I had purchased in the past. It was a noticeable difference, I even went to my friends that were visiting and had them touch it. It felt very luxurious. I decided to wash the sheet and put it on my bed. I used my regular laundry detergent and a liquid fabric softener. I took the sheet out of the dryer immediately after it dried. I discovered the sheet had wrinkled so badly that i didn't want to use it on my bed. I placed in the dryer with a fabric sheet and there was no change. I was really disappointed because the sheet was fabulous before I washed it. I have to say that I later washed the sheet again with liquid fabric softener and dryer sheet and it came out much better. I was able to make my bed and I absolutely loved the way the sheet felt. I am glad that I am able to write this review after I washed the second time because it really is a quality product. I would purchase this brand in the future.                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "9074   I ordered this item & everything went well. It was shipped. CTD then stopped my order & cancelled it. Why you ask? Because once upon a time in Pittsburgh, PA our mayor passed a law that prohibits 'high capacity' magazines. The law was promptly challenged & was promptly found to be unconstitutional by county & state courts. It was also unconstitutional on the Federal level. So here we have a law, which never actually became law, was challenged & struck down never being actually enforced once.\\nCTD told me they're abiding by this backdoor gun control agenda. Yes that's what they told me & I quote: \"They could enact a law just like that tomorrow & CTD does not want to incur any liability associated with being in violation\".\\nYes CTD cancelled my order on the remote chance that my city would EVER legally pass an unconstitutional mag ban! I talked to their head of sales who parroted the same song as the manager I spoke to.\\nHow can this be accepted? Why have guns for sale if this logic is your way of business? Hence I got this through a competitor.  It's a fine magazine & CTD lost out on a contract with my gov't agency I was purchasing on behalf of for MANY other different firearms related products.   \n",

      "10587  I'm a long time customer and love my bedding from The Company Store! The only reason I'm not giving five stars: I can't help but notice as the mother of mixed race children that all the characters on all the sheets are white. I would jump at the opportunity to buy sheets that reflect the beautiful patchwork of human skin tones. Let's see some Black princesses! Mermaids of Color! Diverse skin tones on fairies! Multicultural ice skaters perhaps! Let's make these gorgeous products inclusive to all. I would be the first to buy and tell all my family and friends.

I love this mirror much more, and it's all because of the light. When you turn that light on, you can see every single blemish, scar, pimple and pore when using the magnified mirror.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "393    Poor slow service with no updates. Product took 4 weeks to arrive with no updates or response to emails. When the Nike trainers finally arrived at the Royal Mail pick up point they were now being offered at 50% cheaper directly from Nike. JD offered no price match so they had to be returned the same day! A 25% discount was offered off my next purchase £100 (£25 minimum) but this was nowhere near the £100 saving from Nike! Such a shame as JD are normally so good on service and pricing.

Came in the damaged box but packed very well and nothing were damaged inside.\\nProblem- all part came unnamed as A, B, C...Tried to call for support- never receive call back... spent some time to figure it out... luckily my husband and I had some experience to put furniture together, but no excuse for the company to send all parts with out labels. I placed it in the mud room and will move it to the garage as an utility cabinet in the future                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "953    soft material but scratchy seams. This fabric is nice and soft, feels high quality.  The manufacturer sewed the front placket and hems beautifully so they don't itch.  But they did not do this on the armholes or side seams, thus being scratchy.  Also, the sizing is for ALOT of shrinkage.  I have washed once and the pjs shrank about half as much as they need to to be true to size.  We will see what the next washing does.  I hope it shrinks enough, as these are basically very nice pj's!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

In addition, when I tried to contact customer service, the wait time and hours are not user friendly. Shutterfly needs to ensure they are providing accurately sized envelopes since they apparently carry 5x7 sized envelopes with sealed bottoms to only  fit Smaller cards.

      "3194   I would buy this product again if fresh and not dated. I like this product but variation in quality is frustrating.  Sometimes light in color (fresh) and sometimes dark/orangy ( older and more acidic).  I almost returned this last bottle because of darkness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "3747   Killer touring jacket. If you're looking for a jacket that can do it all, this might be it!\\n\\nI've taken this out for two tours (about 5 miles total each). As someone that usually runs really hot, I've found all the vents on this jacket to be lifesaving. There's two chest vents + underarm vents - right at my core where I hold a lot of weight. Easy to unzip the chest vents on the go. The inside pockets fit my skins with ease for quick laps. Keeps me cool on the climb up and toasty on the descent.\\n\\nI'm usually a sch-medium (in between a small and medium), but found the small to be the perfect fit. The cuffs have a little elasticity to them too which is great for keeping snow out.\\n\\nMy one complaint is that the collar is pretty high - zipped up it covers my nose. This is great when the weather isn't ideal, but hard when I'm just trying to keep my ears warm in mild weather - makes breathing a bit difficult.\\n\\nAll in all, it's a well-rounded jacket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
      "3792   Glimmer instead of glow. I got it to glow in the bath water! The room needs to be completely pitch black, and it will only be a glimmer of light, but it actually did work in my bath.

      "4352   I would buy them again in the future.. I ordered an all blue color jacket. If the all blue is what shows up, I will be happy. The jacket has not yet arrived as of this entry (Friday, 01/08/2021). If the blue/maroon is what arrives I will have to send it back. I don't appreciate a merchant doing substitution. At this date, I'm just waiting for a jacket to arrive. They are a great jacket that will keep you warm in subzero weather. The old one I have at present is wearing out, pocket threads are pulling out with no way to repair them. With the nice thick fleece lining one can't get a needle throuh to sew the pocket tight to the shell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
      "4378   The Good News is that they Stretch!. I ordered the same size as I do in Lee jeans and they appear to be a size smaller than what I expected.  They are advertised as \"Relaxed Fit\" but if not for the stretch denim, they would be too tight.  They were comfortable enough after I got them zipped up, but they are quite snug.  Since other reviewers said they were true to size, I have to assume they were mislabeled?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "4471   Nice but runs small. I needed a nice fleece lined pair of pants for my son. This looked almost perfect.

      "6537   Lovely shoe, order one size up from your usual..

      "6637   The wrong size received. I ordered a 7.5 and my shoes arrived without a shoe box but in a baggy. The tags were off the shoe. The shoes were a six 6! The shoes looked like a return.

      "8884   Slightly Disappointed. I was very excited to try the Company Cotton Percale flat sheet. Once I opened the sheet, I could immediately feel the difference between this sheet and the sheets that I had purchased in the past. It was a noticeable difference, I even went to my friends that were visiting and had them touch it. It felt very luxurious. I decided to wash the sheet and put it on my bed. I used my regular laundry detergent and a liquid fabric softener. I took the sheet out of the dryer immediately after it dried. I discovered the sheet had wrinkled so badly that i didn't want to use it on my bed. I placed in the dryer with a fabric sheet and there was no change. I was really disappointed because the sheet was fabulous before I washed it. I have to say that I later washed the sheet again with liquid fabric softener and dryer sheet and it came out much better. I was able to make my bed and I absolutely loved the way the sheet felt. I am glad that I am able to write this review after I washed the second time because it really is a quality product.

      "9074   CTD are NOT pro 2nd A. I ordered this item & everything went well. It was shipped. CTD then stopped my order & cancelled it. Why you ask? Because once upon a time in Pittsburgh, PA our mayor passed a law that prohibits 'high capacity' magazines. The law was promptly challenged & was promptly found to be unconstitutional by county & state courts. It was also unconstitutional on the Federal level. So here we have a law, which never actually became law, was challenged & struck down never being actually enforced once.\\nCTD told me they're abiding by this backdoor gun control agenda. Yes that's what they told me & I quote: \"They could enact a law just like that tomorrow & CTD does not want to incur any liability associated with being in violation\".\\nYes CTD cancelled my order on the remote chance that my city would EVER legally pass an unconstitutional mag ban! I talked to their head of sales who parroted the same song as the manager I spoke to.\\nHow can this be accepted? Why have guns for sale if this logic is your way of business? Hence I got this through a competitor.  It's a fine magazine & CTD lost out on a contract with my gov't agency I was purchasing on behalf of for MANY other different firearms related products.   \n",
      "9100   You have a repeat customer in me :-). Ordered this blanket for Christmas for my mom and when she called me screaming with joy and showed me the blanket, omg..far exceeded my expectation.  She could not get over how nice the blanket was. \\n Let's talk quality, quality in the sherpa fabric, quality in how crisp and clear the pics were and quality in the color that I chose for the background, absolutely no bleeding of color.  You WILL NOT be disappointed when you order.

      "10587  I would love to see some diversity. I'm a long time customer and love my bedding from The Company Store! The only reason I'm not giving five stars: I can't help but notice as the mother of mixed race children that all the characters on all the sheets are white. I would jump at the opportunity to buy sheets that reflect the beautiful patchwork of human skin tones. Let's see some Black princesses! Mermaids of Color! Diverse skin tones on fairies! Multicultural ice skaters perhaps! Let's make these gorgeous products inclusive to all. I would be the first to buy and tell all my family and friends.

      "10883  Very cute pants but not much stretch to them!. These are great due to the versatility of the color but I'm disappointed that they fit tight like regular jeans with not much wiggle room!

      "11269  Really Pretty Mirror. I love this mirror. I actually have a similar one that is silver with the double-sided mirror, but it doesn't have the light.
